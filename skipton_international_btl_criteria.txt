## Overview

**Expats and Overseas Residents remortgaging or purchasing Buy-To-Let properties in England, Wales or the Scottish mainland.**

The application can be emailed or couriered to our office. Please note, as the application is for non-UK residents the documentation requirements may be more extensive than for similar applications for UK residents to other banks. Please see [Packaging Guidelines](https://www.skiptoninternational.com/expat-mortgage-broker/packaging-guidelines/) for full information.

## Client

1. Each applicant must be a passport holder and have their citizenship noted in the nationality section of their passport for a country not listed in Skipton International's [Restricted Country List](https://www.skiptoninternational.com/expat-mortgage-broker/restricted-countries/).

2. Each applicant must remain resident overseas and not planning to move to the UK in the near future.

3. The client cannot be living, working in a country on our Restricted List. Please refer in relation to client's nationalities which will be reviewed separately. Please note Skipton lends to Australians living outside of Australia.

4. The client is not a Chinese national residing in mainland China. This does not apply to residents of Hong Kong, Chinese nationals living outside mainland China or Expatriates working in mainland China.

5. The client needs to have a UK bank or building society account from which direct debits can be arranged to pay their mortgage. This must be opened prior to application. If they are not using a "major UK Bank" or an easily recognisable Bank or Building Society, they will need to provide an email confirmation from the Bank in question. They must confirm they can allow Direct Debits to be claimed from the account. **Please note that we are unable to accept TransferWise/Wise accounts.**

6. Three months bank statements. This must show their salary / pension being credited and mortgages/ rent being debited (if applicable). The statements must detail account holder's name(s), account number, narrative, debits, credits and running balances. See [packaging guidelines](https://www.skiptoninternational.com/expat-mortgage-broker/packaging-guidelines/) for a full list of required documents.

7. The client can never have been declared bankrupt, insolvent or equivalent and no action should be pending. They should never have entered into any arrangement with creditors or party to a voluntary arrangement. Should never had a property repossessed by a lender or entered into an arrangement for mortgage arrears. They should also not have an unsatisfied court order or have any such actions pending. If a court order has been satisfied, we will look at this on a case by case basis.

## Portfolio Landlord

Once an applicant owns, or will own as a result of their proposed purchase(s), four or more mortgaged Buy-To-Let properties, they are classified as a "Portfolio Landlord" by Skipton International.

If you are a Portfolio Landlord as defined above, Skipton requires any properties within the portfolio to meet Skipton International's Buy-to-Let affordability criteria. This means that rental income must provide a minimum of 125% interest cover, when interest is calculated on total borrowings at a rate of 7.24%. This calculation is applied to all Buy-To-Let properties mortgaged outside Skipton International on a collective basis. In the event of a rental shortfall, the application will be declined.

In addition:

- Skipton International can offer a maximum of 5 Buy-To-Let mortgages to any one client.
- Skipton International is unable to accept applications from clients who have or will have at the end of this transaction more than 10 Buy-To-Let properties.
- Skipton International will allow a maximum of 3 Buy-To-Let properties, within the whole portfolio, to be held within any 1 post code district, e.g. SW1. In the event of more being held, the application will be declined.

The above is not exhaustive just a guide.
