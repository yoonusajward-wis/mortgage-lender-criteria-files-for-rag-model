## Interest Coverage Ratios (ICRs)

Loan affordable where ICR (using valuer's rental assessment and loan amount inclusive of fees) is 125% or more. Some loan types have higher ICR as below. Stressed rate and ICR depend on borrower type, property type and transaction.

**Standard:** Limited Company 125%; Individual Higher Rate Taxpayer 140%*; Like-for-like remortgage and/or lower rate taxpayer 125%.

**HMO, MUFB, FAC:** Limited Company 135%; Individual Higher Rate Taxpayer 150%; Like-for-like remortgage and/or lower rate taxpayer 150%.

**Stressed rate:** Fixed rate 5 years or longer – Payrate used. Fixed rate under 5 years and Tracker – higher of Payrate +2.00% or 5.5%.

*Top slicing or Portfolio Cross Subsidisation may be used as per sections below.

**Like for like:** Remortgage with no additional borrowing beyond amount outstanding (arrangement fees, professional fees, administration costs can be excluded). Evidenced from Equifax; underwriting tolerance two times contractual monthly subscription.

**Top slicing (earned income):** For Standard properties (not New Build, not HMO/MUFB/FAC), individual (not SPV), not like-for-like remortgage – surplus earned income may make up gap between 125% and required ICR. At least one applicant minimum gross income £50k PA (Higher Rate Taxpayer); complete and evidence I&E to show required surplus.

**Portfolio cross-subsidisation:** Portfolio borrower bringing minimum 2 properties to Zephyr – surplus rental from one or more properties mortgaged to Zephyr may make up gap between 125% and required ICR. Aggregate ICR across all Zephyr mortgages must be at least 155% (current interest rate per loan, not stress rate). Surplus can stem from any property type but may only be applied to Standard properties (e.g. HMO surplus can cross-subsidise standard, not vice versa).

**Pipeline cases and stressed rates:** If stressed rate changes between application and completion we will not normally reassess unless material change (e.g. name, address, DOB, personal circumstances) or days since last credit search exceed offer validity. If stressed rate changes between DIP and applicant paying product fee and/or hard footprint, revised stressed rate will be used.
