## SECTION 7 – How It Works

We offer a range of financing options, from simple single residential investment finance to more complex corporate structures including property portfolios.

### 7.1 Rent Only Purchase Plan

* The Bank and the applicant each contribute a percentage towards the purchase or refinance (e.g. Bank 75%, applicant 25%; for refinances the applicant's contribution is equity in the property).
* The Bank leases its share to the applicant for the finance term. The applicant makes monthly rent-only payments; the applicant does not acquire further shares during the term and payments are lower than under Acquisition & Rent.
* The applicant must acquire the Bank's share at the end of the term by a full lump sum Acquisition Payment. Additional Acquisition Payments (AAPs) can reduce this. An Early Redemption Charge (ERC) may apply if the Bank's share is acquired in full or AAPs exceed the 10% annual allowance during the Fixed Rental Rate Period.
* The Bank charges rent for its share until acquired. The applicant must put in place and maintain a financial arrangement to provide the lump sum at term end.

### 7.2 Acquisition & Rent Purchase Plan

* The Bank and the applicant each contribute a percentage (e.g. Bank 75%, applicant 25%; for refinances the applicant's contribution is equity).
* The Bank leases its share to the applicant. The applicant makes monthly acquisition payments; the Bank's share diminishes and the applicant's share increases. The Bank charges rent on its share until acquired.
* The applicant may acquire the Bank's share early via AAPs or at term end. ERC may apply if acquired in full or AAPs exceed 10% annual allowance during the Fixed Rental Rate Period. When the Bank's share is fully acquired, the Bank transfers the registered title to the applicant.

### 7.3 Notes

* On settlement, an Account Settlement Fee is payable per the Bank's Tariff of Charges. Minimum Additional Acquisition Payment (AAP) is £2,000.
* The customer is responsible for solicitor costs, stamp duty and other conveyancing charges (e.g. land registry fees) at outset and on settlement.
