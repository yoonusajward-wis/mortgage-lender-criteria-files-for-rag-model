## Responsible Lending and Delivering Good Customer Outcomes

If a mortgage application is deemed not to be in the interests of the borrowers, as a responsible lender we reserve the right to decline the application or ask for additional documents to support the application. Norton Home Loans are committed to delivering good outcomes for its customers in line with Principle 12 of the Consumer Duty, the crosscutting rules and 4 specific outcomes. We consider the needs, objectives and characteristics of the customer throughout the mortgage design process and application journey, to ensure that we deliver high levels of consumer care and take steps to avoid any foreseeable harm. The delivery of good customer outcomes is central to our culture, mission statement and purpose.

---

## Client Funds

If the mortgage application is a joint application, it is preferable to pay out to a joint bank account or by joint cheque, but if it is not possible, we will pay out to one party upon receipt of verbal confirmation from both applicants during the security call. We will not pay out to anybody not on the proprietorship register of the house.

We will do a security check with all parties to the loan in all cases.

## General Principles of Fair Business Practice

When you signed your Standard Terms of Business, you agreed to comply with all regulatory requirements, including adherence to the FCA's Consumer Duty. Norton and the FCA expect all firms operating within the lending sector to comply with the FCA's rules and guidance. Some of the main highlights are shown below:

* **Distributors** must take steps to ensure the delivery of good customer outcomes.
* **Distributors** must take reasonable steps to comply with the Consumer Duty cross cutting rules, to act in good faith, avoid causing foreseeable harm and enable and support customers achieve their financial goals and objectives.
* **Distributors** must take necessary steps to understand the target market, including their needs, objectives and characteristics, including characteristics of vulnerability.
* **Distributors** must ensure that their services offer fair value, in addition to the lending products they recommend to their customers.
* **Distributors** must take steps to ensure that their communications are tailored to meet the information needs of their customers, in a manner that they can understand, so that they can make an informed decision as to whether the product is suitable for them.
* **Distributors** must take steps to support their customers so that the services offered meet their needs, they perform as expected, and do not pose any unreasonable barriers to exit an agreement, complain, make enquiries, or terminate the relationship with the firm.
* Borrowers must be allowed sufficient time to reflect on the terms and conditions of the proposed agreement and must not be subjected to any high-pressure selling. They need to understand the risks associated with taking out a secured loan on their residential property and should be encouraged to take independent advice before signing and allowed adequate opportunity to do so. This will form part of our final security checks.
* There must be transparency in all dealings with all borrowers, with early disclosure of key contract terms and conditions (including rates and charges).
* Contract terms and conditions must be fair and clear, in plain and intelligible language, which can be easily understood by borrowers.
* No irresponsible lending, with all underwriting decisions being subject to a proper assessment of the borrower's ability to repay the loan without undue hardship and without resort to the security, taking full account of all relevant circumstances and any reasonably foreseeable future circumstances.

## Customers with Characteristics of Vulnerability

The FCA describes a "vulnerable consumer" as "someone who, due to their personal circumstances, is especially susceptible to detriment". This is a very broad description and covers anyone who is at an additional risk of harm as a result of their personal circumstances.

The FCA has identified several risk factors that it considers may be associated with vulnerability including:

* low literacy, numeracy and financial capability skills.
* physical disability.
* severe or long-term illness.
* mental health problems.
* low income (for example, less than **£13,500** per year) and/or debt.
* caring responsibilities.
* being elderly (which may be associated with cognitive or dexterity impairment, sensory impairments such as hearing or sight, onset of ill-health, not being comfortable with new technology).
* being young (associated with less experience).
* change in circumstances (e.g. job loss, bereavement, divorce).
* lack of English language skills.
* Non-standard requirements or credit history (for example armed forces personnel returning from abroad, ex-offenders, care-home leavers, and recent immigrants).

We are also to use our experience of having dealt with potentially vulnerable and vulnerable customers, to know that other factors could be considered as 'triggers' for vulnerability. These may include:

* Bereavement.
* Receipt of certain benefits.
* Relationship breakdowns.
* A sudden change in living arrangements.

There are also many other situations and circumstances. The above categories do not mean a customer is automatically vulnerable, but it means that they are more likely to be more vulnerable than the average customer. We assess vulnerability on a case-by-case basis, focusing on the individual.

Certain individuals with characteristics of vulnerability may have limitations in Financial Literacy and Mental Capacity. Brokers must ensure they adhere to the guidance issued by the Money Advice Liaison Group's Debt and Mental Health Good Practise Guidelines.

Brokers must be aware that if at any point in the application for credit process they suspect or gain knowledge that the customer has mental capacity or financial literacy limitations then they must act in accordance with the MALG guidance.

A non-exhaustive list of circumstances which may lead the Broker to suspect customer limitations in mental capacity or financial literacy follows:

* Where disclosure is given by the applicant.
* Where disclosure is given by someone likely to have an informed view, such as a partner or carer etc.
* Where a Power of Attorney is known to exist.
* Where medical evidence exists or a previous diagnosis.
* Where the applicant acts out of character or in an unexpected manner.
* Where the applicant cannot retain information concerning their application or appears confused about personal or financial information.
* Where the applicant does not understand what they are applying for or information given to them.
* Where the applicant appears unable to weigh up information or communicate their borrowing decision by reasonable means.

Where there is suspicion that an applicant has a mental capacity or financial literacy limitation, the applicant shouldn't be regarded as being unable to make a decision unless steps have been taken to assist first without success.

Brokers should provide assistance to these applicants in clear language to help them make decisions, rather than immediately declining their application.

### The Following Measures Can Be Taken to Help an Applicant's Understanding:

* Providing additional information on the "key risks" of the agreement, which can include features of the agreement, how much they will pay, the consequences of not maintaining payment, advisability of considering pre-contract information and their ability to request further information if required.
* Carrying out a detailed assessment of the applicants' financial circumstances to ensure their ability to afford to meet repayments in a suitable manner.
* Ensuring that applicants do not take unsuitable credit, even where this is affordable. An example would be an applicant settling unsecured credit with a secured loan, without any obvious benefit.
* Giving applicants adequate time to weigh up the information and explanations provided in order to better enable them to reach responsible borrowing decisions.
* Referring the applicant to suitable not-for-profit third parties for additional advice, such as Citizens Advice Bureau.

Where there is suspicion or knowledge of mental capacity or financial literacy limitations, all applications must be referred and marked for the attention of the Norton underwriting team.

You should note what additional steps you have taken to assist customer understanding. Norton may require independent legal advice to be carried out to ensure that the customer has full understanding.

## Responsible Lending and Delivering Good Customer Outcomes

If a mortgage application is deemed not to be in the interests of the borrowers, as a responsible lender we reserve the right to decline the application or ask for additional documents to support the application. Norton Home Loans are committed to delivering good outcomes for its customers in line with Principle 12 of the Consumer Duty, the crosscutting rules and 4 specific outcomes. We consider the needs, objectives and characteristics of the customer throughout the mortgage design process and application journey, to ensure that we deliver high levels of consumer care and take steps to avoid any foreseeable harm. The delivery of good customer outcomes is central to our culture, mission statement and purpose.

## Client Funds

If the mortgage application is a joint application, it is preferable to pay out to a joint bank account or by joint cheque, but if it is not possible, we will pay out to one party upon receipt of verbal confirmation from both applicants during the security call. We will not pay out to anybody not on the proprietorship register of the house.

We will do a security check with all parties to the loan in all cases.

## General Principles of Fair Business Practice

When you signed your Standard Terms of Business, you agreed to comply with all regulatory requirements, including adherence to the FCA's Consumer Duty. Norton and the FCA expect all firms operating within the lending sector to comply with the FCA's rules and guidance. Some of the main highlights are shown below:

* Distributors must take steps to ensure the delivery of good customer outcomes.
* Distributors must take reasonable steps to comply with the Consumer Duty cross cutting rules, to act in good faith, avoid causing foreseeable harm and enable and support customers achieve their financial goals and objectives.
* Distributors must take necessary steps to understand the target market, including their needs, objectives and characteristics, including characteristics of vulnerability.
* Distributors must ensure that their services offer fair value, in addition to the lending products they recommend to their customers.
* Distributors must take steps to ensure that their communications are tailored to meet the information needs of their customers, in a manner that they can understand, so that they can make an informed decision as to whether the product is suitable for them.
* Distributors must take steps to support their customers so that the services offered meet their needs, they perform as expected, and do not pose any unreasonable barriers to exit an agreement, complain, make enquiries, or terminate the relationship with the firm.
* Borrowers must be allowed sufficient time to reflect on the terms and conditions of the proposed agreement and must not be subjected to any high-pressure selling. They need to understand the risks associated with taking out a secured loan on their residential property and should be encouraged to take independent advice before signing and allowed adequate opportunity to do so. This will form part of our final security checks.
* There must be transparency in all dealings with all borrowers, with early disclosure of key contract terms and conditions (including rates and charges).
* Contract terms and conditions must be fair and clear, in plain and intelligible language, which can be easily understood by borrowers.
* No irresponsible lending, with all underwriting decisions being subject to a proper assessment of the borrower's ability to repay the loan without undue hardship and without resort to the security, taking full account of all relevant circumstances and any reasonably foreseeable future circumstances.

## Customers with Characteristics of Vulnerability

The FCA describes a "vulnerable consumer" as "someone who, due to their personal circumstances, is especially susceptible to detriment". This is a very broad description and covers anyone who is at an additional risk of harm as a result of their personal circumstances.

The FCA has identified several risk factors that it considers may be associated with vulnerability including:

* low literacy, numeracy and financial capability skills.
* physical disability.
* severe or long-term illness.
* mental health problems.
* low income (for example, less than **£13,500** per year) and/or debt.
* caring responsibilities.
* being elderly (which may be associated with cognitive or dexterity impairment, sensory impairments such as hearing or sight, onset of ill-health, not being comfortable with new technology).
* being young (associated with less experience).
* change in circumstances (e.g. job loss, bereavement, divorce).
* lack of English language skills.
* Non-standard requirements or credit history (for example armed forces personnel returning from abroad, ex-offenders, care-home leavers, and recent immigrants).

We are also to use our experience of having dealt with potentially vulnerable and vulnerable customers, to know that other factors could be considered as 'triggers' for vulnerability. These may include:

* Bereavement.
* Receipt of certain benefits.
* Relationship breakdowns.
* A sudden change in living arrangements.

There are also many other situations and circumstances. The above categories do not mean a customer is automatically vulnerable, but it means that they are more likely to be more vulnerable than the average customer. We assess vulnerability on a case-by-case basis, focusing on the individual.

Certain individuals with characteristics of vulnerability may have limitations in Financial Literacy and Mental Capacity. Brokers must ensure they adhere to the guidance issued by the Money Advice Liaison Group's Debt and Mental Health Good Practise Guidelines.

Brokers must be aware that if at any point in the application for credit process they suspect or gain knowledge that the customer has mental capacity or financial literacy limitations then they must act in accordance with the MALG guidance.

A non-exhaustive list of circumstances which may lead the Broker to suspect customer limitations in mental capacity or financial literacy follows:

* Where disclosure is given by the applicant.
* Where disclosure is given by someone likely to have an informed view, such as a partner or carer etc.
* Where a Power of Attorney is known to exist.
* Where medical evidence exists or a previous diagnosis.
* Where the applicant acts out of character or in an unexpected manner.
* Where the applicant cannot retain information concerning their application or appears confused about personal or financial information.
* Where the applicant does not understand what they are applying for or information given to them.
* Where the applicant appears unable to weigh up information or communicate their borrowing decision by reasonable means.

Where there is suspicion that an applicant has a mental capacity or financial literacy limitation, the applicant shouldn't be regarded as being unable to make a decision unless steps have been taken to assist first without success.

Brokers should provide assistance to these applicants in clear language to help them make decisions, rather than immediately declining their application.

### The Following Measures Can Be Taken to Help an Applicant's Understanding:

* Providing additional information on the "key risks" of the agreement, which can include features of the agreement, how much they will pay, the consequences of not maintaining payment, advisability of considering pre-contract information and their ability to request further information if required.
* Carrying out a detailed assessment of the applicants' financial circumstances to ensure their ability to afford to meet repayments in a suitable manner.
* Ensuring that applicants do not take unsuitable credit, even where this is affordable. An example would be an applicant settling unsecured credit with a secured loan, without any obvious benefit.
* Giving applicants adequate time to weigh up the information and explanations provided in order to better enable them to reach responsible borrowing decisions.
* Referring the applicant to suitable not-for-profit third parties for additional advice, such as Citizens Advice Bureau.

Where there is suspicion or knowledge of mental capacity or financial literacy limitations, all applications must be referred and marked for the attention of the Norton underwriting team.

You should note what additional steps you have taken to assist customer understanding. Norton may require independent legal advice to be carried out to ensure that the customer has full understanding.
