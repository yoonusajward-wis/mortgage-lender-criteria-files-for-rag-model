## Product Types

### Standard Capital & Interest

Your client repays the capital as well as the interest over a fixed term to maximise the equity in their property. A mix of Capital & Interest and Interest only is available with our Standard Part & Part mortgage.

**Key Features:**
* Available for borrowers aged 50+
* Fixed rate terms available
* Can be used for purchase or remortgage
* Part & Part option available (mix of Capital & Interest and Interest Only)

### Standard Interest Only

Your client pays just the interest each month, paying us back the capital when their chosen term ends. This is unlike a RIO, which has no specified maturity date. A mix of Capital & Interest and Interest only is available with our Standard Part & Part mortgage.

**Key Features:**
* Available for borrowers aged 50+
* Fixed rate terms available
* Can be used for purchase or remortgage
* Part & Part option available (mix of Capital & Interest and Interest Only)
* Capital repayment required at end of term

### Retirement Interest Only (RIO)

Designed for your clients who have no plans to move again – and they don't have to be retired.

**Key Features:**
* **Up to 75% LTV** - Borrow up to 75% loan to value
* **50 years minimum age** - 50 years minimum age (at application). No maximum age. For joint borrowers, the youngest borrower can be minimum 45
* **Widest range of fixed rates** - 2, 5 and 10 year fixed and fixed for life currently available
* **Up to 1.10% gross proc fee** - We have 3 proc fee options:
  * Standard Proc Fee of 0.55% gross upfront
  * Ongoing Proc Fee of 0.55% gross upfront plus an additional 0.13% gross every year thereafter, for up to 15 years
  * (Fixed for Life products only) Enhanced Proc Fee of 1.10% gross upfront
* **No end date** - Your client may never need another mortgage
* **Repayment** - The mortgage is repaid from the sale of their home when they pass away or move into long-term care

**Product Rates (as of 2025):**
* 2 year fixed rate from 5.59%
* 5 year fixed rate from 5.58%
* 10 year fixed rate from 6.14%
* Fixed for Life rate from 6.44%

**Suitable for:**
* Purchasing a new property
* Remortgaging an existing loan
* Generating funds for home improvements, lifestyle or to start a Bank of Mum and Dad
* IHT planning and wealth management
* Those looking for an alternative to Equity Release products due to requirement of higher loan amount, income to service interest or to avoid the impact of roll-up compounding interest

**Note:** Our Ongoing Proc Fee and Enhanced Proc Fee require an annual customer care call.

### Lifetime Mortgage (Equity Release)

This is a type of equity release where your client receives a lump sum and doesn't have to make monthly payments.

**Key Features:**
* **Age 55** - Available from age 55 to 90
* **No monthly payments** - Your client doesn't need to make any payments or they can choose to pay up to 10% or 15% per year (based upon the product selected). They can make payments every month with a minimum of £200 payment
* **Downsize Protection** - No early repayment charges (ERCs) after day one if your client moves to a property that doesn't meet our lending criteria and they are unable to transfer the mortgage
* **Roll-up / Compound Interest** - Any interest your client doesn't service each month is added to the total loan balance. Interest is then added on top of that, meaning the amount they owe can grow quickly
* **Equity Release Council approved** - An additional option for your clients if you have the relevant Equity Release qualification
* **Drawdown** - We offer a drawdown facility with no monthly payments required. Borrowers can access their drawdown facility 6 months after completion

**Product Rates (as of 2025):**
* Standard from 7.24%
* Five Year ERC from 7.44%
* Six Month Offer (Purchase) from 7.44%
* Property + from 8.19%

**Suitable for:**
* Those who don't intend to make payments each month
* Remortgaging an existing loan
* Generating funds e.g. for home improvements, lifestyle or to start a Bank of Mum and Dad
* IHT planning and wealth management

**Important Information:**
* Intermediaries require the appropriate Equity Release qualification (CeRER) to advise their clients on our Lifetime Mortgage
* All borrowers will require independent legal advice
* Use our Lifetime Mortgage Calculator to see how much your client could potentially borrow

**How it differs from a normal mortgage:**
* Your client doesn't need to make any monthly payments, but they can if they want to service some or all of the monthly interest
* If they don't do this, the interest will 'roll up' or compound and be added to what they owe
* The amount borrowed (plus any charges or interest accumulated) is usually repaid when they pass away or move into long-term care
* They will always own their home and it will never be repossessed, as long as they abide by the terms and conditions

**Difference between Lifetime Mortgage and RIO:**
* Our Lifetime Mortgage is a type of equity release, and like a RIO, it has no specified end date
* The key difference is that a RIO has contractual monthly interest-only payments whereas a Lifetime Mortgage does not
* With a RIO you are paying off the interest we charge each month. With a Lifetime Mortgage, we still charge this interest but it is added to the balance that you owe us and compounds over the life of the loan
* Therefore, with a RIO the amount you owe us will remain the same, whereas with a Lifetime Mortgage, it will increase over time
