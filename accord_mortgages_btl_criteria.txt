# Portfolio landlord

[Background BTL portfolio](#background-btl-portfolio)

## Portfolio landlord definition

**Definition of a Portfolio landlord**

* Portfolio landlords will be defined as those having 4 or more mortgaged BTL properties.
* The definition is applicable at application level not applicant level. Therefore for 2 landlords applying together, the total number of their individual and joint mortgaged properties will be taken into account.
* We'll include other applications currently 'In-flight' with Accord and other lenders to determine the total number of mortgaged BTL properties.

Examples:

| Scenario                                                                                                                           | Portolio landlord? |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1 | App 1 and 2 have 3 BTL properties in joint names and App 1 has another in sole name                                            | Yes                |
| 2 | App 1 and 2 have 2 BTL properties in joint names                                                                                  | No                 |
| 3 | App 1 and 2 have 4 BTL mortgages held in joint names and are remortgaging one of these to Accord                                 | Yes                |
| 4 | App 1 and 2 have 2 BTL mortgages in joint names. They're applying to us to purchase another property and they have an 'in-flight' application with another lender | Yes                |
| 5 | App 1 and 2 have 5 BTL properties in joint names, 2 are unencumbered. Applicants are looking to raise funds with Accord on one of the unencumbered properties. | Yes                |
| 6 | App 1 and 2 have 3 BTL properties in joint names which are unencumbered. They're applying to us to purchase another property.  | No                 |

We'll assess the financial strength and competency of a portfolio landlord by taking into consideration their experience in the buy-to-let market, their full property portfolio and any outstanding mortgages along with their assets and liabilities.

Our existing rental calculations will apply for new borrowing. All background properties must collectively meet a minimum rental calculation of 145% interest coverage ratio (ICR) at a stressed rate of 5.0%.

In addition to our standard criteria, portfolio landlords will be required to supply details of any applications currently being processed with other lenders and complete an assets statement. We'll also ask these landlords if they anticipate any financial changes or changes in circumstances which could impact the affordability of their portfolio.

## Portfolio lending limits

**Maximum portfolio lending**
Maximum Group BTL exposure to an individual is £1,000,000 for a first time landlord and £3,000,000 for an experienced landlord.

Maximum total exposure - no limit to the total number of properties (max. 10 with mortgages).

Maximum number of Group BTL loans is 3 for first time landlords and 5 for experienced landlords.

**Maximum properties in portfolio**
We do not have a maximum number of properties allowed in a portfolio. However, no more than 10 properties in the portfolio can be mortgaged.

**Is there a maximum LTV applied on individual units in the portfolio?**
We won't assess the LTV on any portfolio properties, only the new loan being applied for. We'll look at LTVs in respect of the overall quality of an application.

**Maximum LTV on portfolio**
We don't assess the LTV at portfolio level.

**Are inflight applications included in the total allowable number of portfolio properties?**
No, we only count inflight applications when assessing whether the applicant is a portfolio landlord or not. Inflight applications will not count towards the total number of properties you are allowed and won't be included in our rental calculation.

## Background BTL portfolio

All background properties must collectively meet a minimum rental calculation of 145% interest coverage ratio (ICR) at a stressed rate of 5.0%.

**How we assess coverage**
When reviewing a BTL portfolio we do individually assess properties, but where an individual property in the portfolio doesn't meet the 145% rule, but other properties in the portfolio would cover the shortfall, we do consider the portfolio as a whole.

Examples:

#### Strong Portfolio

| Property 1            | Property 2            | Property 3            | Property 4            | Property 5            |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Self-financing 150%   | Self-financing 146%   | Self-financing 148%   | Self-financing 140%   | Self-financing 167%   |

Whilst property 4 is not meeting the 145% rule, collectively the remaining properties are self-financing by 153%.

This is sufficient to cover the shortfall, pulling up the portfolio collectively to 150%.

#### Weak Portfolio

| Property 1            | Property 2            | Property 3            |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Self-financing 145%   | Self-financing 137%   | Self-financing 148%   |

The portfolio as a whole is not meeting the 145% rule, and whilst one property is above the required 145%, this is not by a substantial amount.

For product transfers, the minimum term remaining on the mortgage in order to take a product is dependent on the products available at the time and the term remaining on the mortgage.

## Loan and LTV limits

The following table outlines our current loan limits for both Interest only and repayment (capital and interest):

| Borrower type                                     | Loan up to £500k                                           | £500k - £1m | Flats | Houses |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----- | ------ |
| First time landlords                              | 80% (Excl. unsecured debt consolidation)                   | 75%         | 75%   | 75%    |
| Existing landlords                                | 80% (Excl. unsecured debt consolidation)                   | 75%         | 75%   | 75%    |

## Portfolio lending limits

**Maximum portfolio lending**
Maximum Group BTL exposure to an individual is £1,000,000 for a first time landlord and £3,000,000 for an experienced landlord.

Maximum total exposure - no limit to the total number of properties (max. 10 with mortgages).

Maximum number of Group BTL loans is 3 for first time landlords and 5 for experienced landlords.

**Maximum properties in portfolio**
We do not have a maximum number of properties allowed in a portfolio. However, no more than 10 properties in the portfolio can be mortgaged.

**Is there a maximum LTV applied on individual units in the portfolio?**
We won't assess the LTV on any portfolio properties, only the new loan being applied for. We'll look at LTVs in respect of the overall quality of an application.

**Maximum LTV on portfolio**
We don't assess the LTV at portfolio level.

**Are inflight applications included in the total allowable number of portfolio properties?**
No, we only count inflight applications when assessing whether the applicant is a portfolio landlord or not. Inflight applications will not count towards the total number of properties you are allowed and won't be included in our rental calculation.

## Exposure limits

Maximum exposure to any block of flats or development is limited to 25%.
A maximum of 1 flat/unit will be acceptable as security in all buildings made up of 4 or less flats/units. The 25% exposure limit will also continue to apply for blocks greater than 4.

## Loan and LTV limits for foreign nationals

All applicants must be resident in the UK at the time of application.

**EU citizens**
Customers whose nationality is not British or Irish must provide evidence that they have either indefinite leave to remain or right to reside, via a passport (showing stamp), EU settlement scheme share code or confirmation from the Home Office – LTV limit restrictions are in place for customers without indefinite leave to remain or pre-settled.

**European Economic Area**
Applicants from countries, which are members of the European Economic Area, can also be accepted within normal lending criteria.

These include: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.

**Indefinite leave to remain**
Evidence of indefinite leave is required for over 75% LTV lending. This should be evidenced either by a stamp in the applicant's passport, or by a letter from the Home Office.

**Settled/pre-settled status**
Evidence of settled/pre-settled status is required. The share code, which is provided as part of the EU Settlement Scheme, should be provided.

**Joint applications where one applicant has indefinite leave to remain**
Where at least one applicant on a joint application has indefinite leave to remain or is a British citizen then we can now offer up to 75% LTV lending subject to standard product and eligibility criteria. If both applicants have indefinite leave to remain, pre-settled/settled status or British citizenship we can consider up to max 80% LTV.

**No settled/pre-settled status or indefinite leave to remain not granted**
This is acceptable at a maximum LTV of 75%.
All applicants must have evidence that they can currently reside in the UK e.g. immigration documentation or passport stamp.

### Page contents

[Top slicing](#top-slicing)

## Rental coverage

Please use the [rental calculator](https://www.accordmortgages.com/btl/rental-calculator) to check the rental coverage you need before you submit an application. Our Interest coverage ratio (ICR) is calculated based on property tenure, mortgage type and term. The rental figure is based on an unfurnished property and must be confirmed by the valuer.
To calculate the maximum borrowing available, we take the lower of the rent received or how much a valuer thinks the property will rent for.
We apply different ICRs dependant on circumstances, these are as follows:

| Applicant Tax rate                                | Product term | ICR   | ICR Rate                                          | ICR   | ICR Rate                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic rate*                                       | < 5 years    | 125%  | The higher of 5.5% or product rate +2.0%         | 125%  | The higher of 5.5% or product rate +1.0%         |
| Basic rate*                                       | >= 5 years   | 125%  | The higher of 4.75% or product rate +1.0%          | 125%  | The higher of 4.75% or product rate +1.0%         |
| Higher rate**                                     | < 5 years    | 145%  | The higher of 5.5% or product rate +2.0%           | 145%  | The higher of 5.5% or product rate +1.0%           |
| Higher rate**                                     | >= 5 years   | 145%  | The higher of 4.75% or product rate +1.0%          | 145%  | The higher of 4.75% or product rate +1.0%          |

*Basic rate taxpayer: Where all applicants on the application have a taxable income of no more than £50,271 in England and Wales/£43,663 in Scotland AND are basic rate taxpayers or pay 0% tax after completion of the application.
**Higher Rate Taxpayer: Applications where at least 1 applicant has a taxable income greater than £50,271 in England and Wales/£43,663 in Scotland and/or those which are higher rate taxpayers or additional rate taxpayers after completion of the application.

## Rental valuation

The rental value figure must be on an unfurnished gross monthly basis on an Assured Short hold tenancy for 6 months or on a proper tenancy if the rent is over £100,000 pa (equivalents in Scotland and Wales). There must be good demand for rental property in the area concerned.

## Top slicing

We may be able to use surplus personal income (top slicing) to cover a rental shortfall when we assess affordability for a BTL loan.

**In order for your application to qualify for top slicing the following criteria should be met:**
* Where surplus earned income is being used to cover any rental shortfall (Top Slicing) customers must reside at the same address.
* For single and joint applicants, the minimum income (not from rental properties) is £50,000.
* The interest coverage ratio based on rental income only must be greater than or equal to 100% and less than the minimum required ICR threshold for the application as set out in this policy
* Maximum LTV of 75%

**Top slicing is not allowed in these cases:**
* Lending to first time landlords (For an application to be classed as a First Time Landlord, all applicants, at the time of application, do not own a property that they have let out for more than 12 months)
* Lending where the security is a new build property
* Let To Buy applications
* Capital raising for unsecured debt consolidation or to cover other personal expenditure (e.g. Car Purchase, Holiday, School fees, Gift to relative).

To see a breakdown of the types of income we accept and the evidence required, please see our [income and top slicing criteria page](https://www.accordmortgages.com/btl/criteria/income-and-top-slicing).

* Any flats that exceed 4 storeys must have adequate lift arrangements.

## Energy performance certificate

In order for a property to be deemed as acceptable security, it must have a minimum Energy Performance Rating of E, unless the property has a valid exemption.

A valuation report will only be returned if the property has a valid EPC with a rating of A – E. If the valuation has an EPC below E and does not have a valid exemption, the property is deemed unsuitable for our security and the application will be declined. To find whether a property in England or Wales has a valid exemption, the property can be checked on the [GOV.UK PRS exemptions register](https://prsregister.beis.gov.uk/NdsBeisUi/register-search-exemptions).

## Solar panels

Solar panels are acceptable subject to a satisfactory valuation being returned. Please note some restrictions may apply to solar panels that were previously installed free of charge and have certain lease restrictions, please contact our support team or your business development manager for queries of this nature.

## Cladding

Where the valuer has requested an EWS1 form due to the cladding being present on the property the following guidance will apply.
A completed EWS1 form will be required from a member of a relevant professional body, along with a covering letter on headed paper which will confirm they are suitably qualified. This will then be assessed by our underwriters.
If an EWS1 form is not available for a new build property a letter from the developer can now be accepted. This is subject to the letter being on a headed letter with the developer's company details clearly present. The letter must confirm that the property is being built in accordance with the Building (Amendment) Regulations SI 2018/1230 and/or, that there are no materials included in the building of the flats that would cause an EWS1 form to be unsuitable.

## Japanese knotweed

If Japanese knotweed is present at the property, the valuer must confirm what category/stage the knotweed is at and the following rules must be applied;

Category A and B – The property may be considered as acceptable for mortgage purposes, subject to an inspection by a suitably qualified remediation specialist and commitment shown to the commencement of any recommended works under an insurance backed Japanese Knotweed Management Plan
Category C and D – Acceptable to lend

If the valuer identifies a heavy stand of Japanese knotweed on neighbouring land (eg very close to the boundary) that may present a threat, the subject property should be declined.

## Minimum property value

The minimum property valuation is £75,000 (in current condition). The property must be suitable for immediate letting at the time of valuation.

The minimum property valuation for new build properties is £100,000.

## Reports and retentions

Where a valuer requests specialist reports, such reports will be referred to the valuer for analysis and comment prior to any offer being issued. No funds will be released until the property has been confirmed as suitable for lending.

Accord BTL will not hold any retentions for works to be completed. The property must be suitable for immediate letting at the time of the valuers inspection.

## Exposure limits

Maximum exposure to any block of flats or development is limited to 25%.
A maximum of 1 flat/unit will be acceptable as security in all buildings made up of 4 or less flats/units. The 25% exposure limit will also continue to apply for blocks greater than 4.

Suitable buildings insurance must be in place at completion (remortgage) or at exchange (purchase). The insurer must be aware that the property is to be let. Our interest must be noted in the policy.

## Inter-family purchase

At the time of application the customer must have owned the property for a minimum of 6 months. There is no minimum period of ownership when a property has been inherited.

## Inherited properties

There is no minimum period of ownership when a property has been inherited.

## Overriding interest

We will not consider applications where:

* The property is being sold by a family member at a discounted price.
* A previous owner retains an interest in the security.
* Any tenant retains or may acquire an overriding interest in the property.

## Flying freehold

Flying Freehold is only acceptable where it is 15% or less of the whole property footprint.

## Steel framed properties

An Intrusive Structural Report (in accordance with BRE113) must be obtained on all pre-1980 Steel.

## Mundic

Mundic Properties are of concrete block construction, often found in Cornwall and Devon. Concrete deteriorates and in the worst cases the property may need to be demolished.

A - Acceptable
A/B - Should be referred to the valuer to check it doesn't affect his valuation
B and below - Not acceptable

[Pre offer/offer validity](#pre-offeroffer-validity)

## Acceptable incentives for new builds

Acceptable builders incentives:

* For houses and bungalows: the maximum allowable builder's incentive is 5%. If the total value of incentives exceeds 5% of the purchase price, the difference should be deducted from the purchase price and LTV calculated on the lower figure
* For flats and maisonettes: where the builder's incentive is cash back or deposit paid, this is not acceptable unless the full incentive is deducted from the purchase price to calculate the loan to value. Any other incentives must not exceed 5%

## Acceptable warranties for new builds

Acceptable new build warranties are:

* NHBC
* Premier Guarantee
* LABC
* Building Life Plans (BLP)
* Build-Zone
* Checkmate/Castle 10 (nb. where out buildings such as a detached garage are also being constructed an endorsement to include these in cover is required)
* Build Assure
* Global Home Warranties
* The Q Policy for residential properties
* The Q Policy for bespoke properties
* Protek
* Advantage (Insurer: Elite Insurance Company). (There must be no more than 10 units in any continuous structure)

* Aedis (nb. There must be no more than 20 units in the structure)
* One Guarantee
* CRL new build 10-year structural defects insurance policy for residential property**

** New properties where the insurer is International General Insurance Company (UK) Ltd and Ark have signed the final certificate. Please see the final paragraph on the final certificate which will confirm Ark details and the fact they are signing on behalf of the insurers: Acceptable.

**Modern Methods of Construction (MMC)**

Many different types of construction are now being designed and developed employing off-site manufacture. These often have a timber or a light gauge steel frame, with a variety of claddings. These properties are acceptable once we have a satisfactory report from the valuer confirming their saleability and demand.

Ideally, the property should be approved under (BOPAS) Buildoffsite Property Assurance Scheme which means that it has passed a 60 year durability assessment and has a 12 year structural warranty.

Acceptability will be reviewed by the Group's valuers based upon:

* Planning/Building Regulation compliance
 or Professional Consultants Certificate in standard CML format
* Eligibility for buildings insurance cover on normal terms
* Acceptability to other mainstream lenders
* 60 years minimum design life assessment tested by a British accredited body (i.e. BBA or BRE)
* Satisfactory construction standards, site and valuation.
