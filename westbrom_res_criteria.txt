# Lending and Security Guidelines 

## Intermediary Use Only

Last updated: October 2025

This document provides guidance for mortgage intermediaries on the areas the West Brom will consider as part of its mortgage underwriting processes.

In addition to the guidelines set out in this document, the West Brom also applies a number of proprietary credit assessment tools, the outcome of which may result in a case being declined despite appearing to fit within the guidelines set out in this document.

The West Brom retains the right to change its underwriting policy at any time and without necessarily updating these guidelines. However, the West Brom will endeavour to ensure the guidelines set out in this document represent the Society's current approach to lending.

In the event of any clarification being required please contact your Business Development Manager (BDM). Prior to submission of supporting documentation please contact the BDM for clarification of any items or policy which may require further investigation to ensure cases are processed in a timely manner.
