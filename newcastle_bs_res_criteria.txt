## Affordability assessment

The Society undertakes a thorough affordability assessment to ensure that we lend responsibly. How much you can borrow is calculated through a combination of your income, regular financial commitments and household / lifestyle expenditure and the term required at an agreed stressed rate to ensure that affordability still exists beyond the initial product rate.

    In assessing affordability all unsecured loans / HPI agreements that have more than 6 months to run, credit cards and maintenance will be deducted. In addition, deductions to applicant's disposable income will also be made for declared household and lifestyle expenditure which is compared against statistical data for accuracy. We request that you obtain accurate details of your applicant's income and expenditure which will ensure a more accurate calculation. We also recommend that prior to beginning a Decision in Principle that you have ran your clients through our affordability calculator to ensure that the loan is affordable.

If you have any questions about how to use the calculator, please refer to our frequently asked questions section. You can also contact our Intermediary Support team at 0345 602 2338 for help.

## Applicant age

Minimum age at application: 18 years. Maximum age at application: 78 years.

    There is no maximum age limit for borrowers at the end of the loan term if the loan is on a Capital Repayment basis (please refer to our later life lending criteria below). However, if any element of the loan is Interest Only, lending will not be approved beyond the age of 80.

---

## Affordability Boost

We understand that affordability can be a key challenge for many people, so that’s why we have a range of products to help.

    Our Affordability Boost range offers a better affordability assessment for fixed-rate mortgages of longer than five years. This means your client may be able to borrow more, depending on their financial situation.

This will be available for those who select a product term of more than 5 years and is not available for all lending types and cannot be combined with another product i.e. Interest Only, Enhanced+, Shared Ownership, Government First Homes.

Read more about our Affordability Boost range here.

## Armed forces personnel

All applicants must have at least 2 years to serve.

    Where the applicant will also live in accommodation provided by M.O.D. then they must be able to support both the new mortgage and any associated living costs for the M.O.D. property. This must be factored into the affordability assessment.

    Where the applicant will be living in M.O.D. accommodation on a full time basis then the property to be purchased must be occupied by spouse/partner.

    Where it is a sole applicant, purchasing the property it must be occupied on a full time basis. It must be plausible that applicant can commute to place of work on a daily basis unless on tour overseas.

    Given nature of employment, it is often difficult to locate applicant on the voters roll. Whilst we would still expect applicant to provide proof of residency we no longer require an explanation as to why they do not appear on the voters roll.

    A 3 year residency history is required. BFPO addresses are acceptable as our credit search facility is able to search these addresses.

    Lending will be permitted to customers utilising the Forces Help to Buy Scheme subject to;

  • Provision of the applicants 'Forces Help to Buy Loan - Personal Information Note' from the Ministry of Defence in order to verify the detail of the loan being granted under the scheme and;
  • The proposed monthly repayment and insurance premium disclosed in to be taken as a commitment for affordability purposes.

    For the avoidance of doubt, 100% of the deposit can be funded via the Forces Help to Buy Scheme. A personal contribution to the deposit from the applicant themselves is not required.

    For Armed Forces personnel where consent to let is required, no fees will be charged and the interest rate will not be loaded. This is irrespective of where the borrower will be based.

---

## British nationals returned from abroad

It is expected the applicant would have resided back in the UK for a minimum of 6 months and are able to provide the last 6 months bank statements to ascertain credit conduct. However applications will be considered where applicants have resided back in the UK for less than 6 months where underwriters are able to evidence sufficient acceptable credit bureau data and credit track record.

    Self employed applicants will not be considered, as there would be insufficient track record of earnings in the UK.

    The property must be occupied by applicant and immediate family.

---

## British nationals working abroad

We will expect that the borrower's main residence is currently within the UK and that they will reside in the property whilst in the UK. We do not accept 'ex-pat' type scenarios where the applicant wishes to purchase a property in the UK and return at a later date.

    We will only consider applications where the applicant's spouse/partner or immediate family will be a permanent resident in the property. The property must not be left unoccupied for more than 30 days a year.

    If the applicant is required to pay for accommodation whilst working abroad then details of this must be disclosed during the application process and deductions made within the affordability assessment.

We would normally expect to see salary paid into a UK bank account either direct or via transfer. The salary paid must be in UK sterling. We do not accept salary paid in any other currency as we do not currently lend for Foreign Currency Loans (see below).

    The employer must be generally 'Blue Chip' for both UK and International companies.

    The max LTV for British Nationals Working Abroad is 80%.

    We expect applicants to currently or previously have held a UK mortgage.

    Where we cannot confirm the applicant via our credit search then we must have a minimum of last 6 months bank statements, a copy of the current and previous contracts to establish a track record in their chosen industry.



### Buy to Let properties (already owned)

For those applicants who already have 1 or more investment mortgage, we will consider up to 95% LTV on the basis that we receive:

  • Evidence that the mortgage conduct on all investment mortgages is satisfactory with no missed payments. Sight of conduct via credit bureau data is acceptable.
  • Rental income required for affordability - the rental income is to be input as income and the mortgage payment as a commitment to assess overall affordability.
  • Rental income not required for affordability - the rental income received must cover the current mortgage payment by at least 145%. If there is a shortfall, this needs to be added as a commitment.
  • Where applicants have a significant investment portfolio (greater than 5), then we would also expect to have sight of their BTL portfolio summary.
  • Please see 'Let to Buy' for those applicants who are looking to rent out their existing property and purchase a new home to reside in through Newcastle Building Society.

Our full Buy to Let lending policy is available here.

## Contract workers

Contract workers are considered a higher risk to the Society because there are concerns about their affordability once their contract ends. To mitigate this risk, we require a work history of at least 2 years in the same sector, with no more than a 6-week gap between contracts. This work history must be documented through P60s, tax calculations and overviews, or financial accounts.

    The only exceptions to this requirement are qualified teachers, medical professionals, and solicitors. Due to the nature of their professions, we expect these individuals to have more stable careers.

    **Day-rate contractors/Umbrella companies/IR35**

    For day-rate contractors, umbrella companies, or IR35 workers, we require:

  • Copies of current and previous contracts covering the last 12 months.
  • Applicants must have 12 months’ experience as a contractor at the time of application.
  • The current contract to have at least one month remaining, or evidence of a new or extended contract.
  • One-month bank statement copy

    Please note: Contracts quoting a daily or weekly rate will be calculated based on an assumed 46-week annual income.

    If paid through an umbrella company, the total gross pay on the payslips may include different components like basic salary, commission, additional taxable income, and holiday pay. If the contract confirms the contractor is paid via a daily or hourly rate, the income does not need to be split into these separate elements and can all be keyed as basic salary.

    For applicants on a PAYE basis (including IR35), the income will be calculated based on the lower figure from either the latest contract or the average of the last three months of payslips. One month's bank statement and proof of a two-year work history will also need to be provided.

    If the applicant is self-employed, their income will be based on their latest contract. Evidence of a two-year work history will need to be provided.

    **Fixed-term contract/Recruitment agency/Zero-hour contracts/Nurse Bank Staff**

    We accept 100% of income if a two-year track record in the chosen industry can be provided. This can be evidenced through P60s or tax calculations and relevant overviews. For those on zero-hour contracts, nurse bank staff, or agency work, we require three months of payslips. If they are paid weekly, you will need to provide four weekly payslips to cover one full month.

    **CIS workers**

    Workers paid under the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) can be considered if proof of income for the past two years is provided. This should be evidenced by SA302 forms and any supporting documentation.

    **Early Career Teachers (ECT)**

    Early Career Teachers (previously known as NQTs) will only be considered if they are in their second year of the program.

    **Junior Doctors**

    Only Junior Doctors who are in Foundation Year 2 or higher will be accepted. Foundation Year 1 Junior Doctors are not eligible.

## Credit scoring

As part of our overall assessment, the Society will credit score all mortgage applications to assess the credit worthiness of applicants. Applicants will be credit scored at Decision in Principle stage and this will leave a soft footprint on their credit file. Please note, this will leave a hard footprint if the case proceeds to a full mortgage application.

    The credit score will either accept, decline or refer applications to underwriters for a manual assessment.

---

## Defaults and CCJs

The Society will use credit scoring to determine whether to proceed with an application. Applications will normally be declined in the following circumstances:

  • Current secured arrears or recent history of non payment
  • Current unsecured arrears or history of delinquency in last 3 years
  • Any type of unsatisfied CCJ or Default irrespective of amount (£)
  • Any secured or unsecured credit related CCJ or defaults which have been satisfied within the last 3 years irrespective of when registered
  • Any insolvency i.e. Bankruptcy / IVA / DRO that has been satisfied within the last 3 years
  • Any evidence of previous or current property being repossessed
  • We will not lend on cases where there is active debt management or evidence of any active debt collection payments and any debt management /collection programme must be settled for at least 12 months, with satisfactory credit record demonstrated since that time

    Our underwriters may be willing to accept a maximum of 2 satisfied defaults/CCJs below £250 from utility companies, communications or mail order with satisfactory explanation within the last 3 years. This is still subject to the whole case being good quality.

## Decisions in Principle (DIP)

You can register and submit a residential DIP via our website Newcastle for Intermediaries online portal.

    By registering online, you will set up your unique login details and, once approved, join our panel of advisers. We will aim to review your registration within three to five working hours of you applying (Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm).

    Once you have been accepted, you will be able to log in and get an instant decision in principle, confirming whether a client has been approved for a mortgage with us, as well as manage DIP cases you have submitted online.

    On completion of the DIP, you can now progress to full application and also submit supporting documentation via our document upload facility.

---

## Dependent relatives

A definition of a dependent relative is a father, mother, son or daughter whom our applicant is purchasing a property for:

  • The applicant must be able to afford both this mortgage and their existing mortgage. Full details of the existing commitment must be obtained;
  • For affordability purposes, the applicant's current mortgage commitment will be taken as a monthly commitment;
  • Consent to Mortgage forms for the dependent relative must be obtained by the acting solicitor;
  • Where re-mortgaging, care must be taken to establish that there has been "no undue influence" applied;
  • Further advances are available once the mortgage has completed 12 months and conduct has been satisfactory; and
  • We do not accept regulated Buy to Let, where the dependent relative pays any form of rent to the borrower.

---

## Employment references

Where an applicant has been employed for less than 6 months we may require sight of the employment contract. This is instead of an employment reference which can often lead to delays in processing the application.

---

## Enhanced+

### Loan to Value (LTV)

Our maximum LTV is set out in the table below.

### Income multiple caps

We require you to provide us with a true reflection of the applicant's expenditure so that we can ensure affordability is calculated correctly.

Income multiples are capped at 6x income for employed applicants and 5.5x income for self-employed applicants. For joint applications, where one applicant is self employed and their total income is >50% of the other applicant's non self-employed income, the 5.5x income will apply.

### Overtime/ bonus/ commission income

We can take up to 100% of frequent payments (overtime/bonus /commission) where:

  • Paid monthly as evidenced on last three months consecutive payslips; and
  • Year to date earnings on payslips must show these payments have been consistent.

    We can take 100% of less frequent bonus payments where:

  • A two year track record is available via the last two P60s
  • Gross income, including bonus, must be in excess of £100,000.

### Non-standard Income

We can consider SIPP (Self Invested Personal Pension) and RSU (Restricted Share Unit) as an additional income. This will be on a case by case basis and subject to agreement from the underwriter.

If your client has one of these income streams, please get in touch with your BDM to discuss your case and access our dedicated Enhanced+ underwriting service.

### Repayment options

    Criteria for Interest Only loans:

  • Maximum LTV on Interest Only is 80% with maximum of 85% overall (subject to maximum loan size / LTV above);
  • We will accept Downsizing via Sale of Property where Interest Only exposure is capped at 60% LTV, and must have a minimum of £250,000 equity on completion in London/South East regions, and a minimum of £150,000 equity on completion in all other regions. A combination of repayment vehicles (including downsizing via sale of mortgaged property) can be accepted. Downsizing will still be capped at 60% and have the minimum equity requirements however, additional repayment vehicles can be used up to a maximum LTV of 80%. Any additional borrowing must be on a capital repayment basis (subject to maximum loan size/LTV above.
  • All other acceptable forms of repayment would need to match current lending policy. This includes:

      • Endowment Plan(s) using the midpoint projection
      • Pension Plan(s) where term cannot exceed retirement age
      • PEPS
      • Investments (ISA's / Bond's / Unit Trusts)
      • Share portfolio where current value of portfolio is sufficient to repay loan
      • Regular bonus payments (bonus must be established as part of income verification)
      • Sale of investment property
      • Regular overpayments (either monthly or via periodic lump sum repayments)

## Family purchases

Where it has been established that the property is to be purchased at a discounted price then we can consider lending 100% of the purchase price subject to valuation confirming that LTV based on open market value would not exceed 95%.

    Additional borrowing above the discounted purchase price can only be considered subject to funds being for home improvements only and LTV not to exceed 95% of open market value. No capital raising for repayment of debt is allowed.

    The acting solicitor must ensure that defective title indemnity insurance is arranged where a discounted purchase price is taking place. This protects the Society from future claims under the Insolvency Act.

    The current occupant of the property would be expected to move out of the property. We will not accept a sitting tenant and the property must be vacant on completion with no charges /restrictions from previous owner remaining.

    Maximum loan is £500,000.

---

## Foreign currency loans

We will no longer accept mortgage applications where the salary paid in a currency other than UK sterling is to be used for affordability purposes.

    In addition, we will no longer accept other sources of income that is not UK sterling based i.e. rent received from overseas properties, overseas investments.

    Where the loan is interest only or part interest only / part capital repayment we are also unable to accept a repayment strategy that is based on assets that are held outside the UK.

---

## Foreign nationals

**EEA Nationals:**

  • EU/EEA/Swiss citizens (excluding Republic of Ireland) applying for a mortgage must currently reside in the UK and have settled status. However, if another party on the mortgage is a UK citizen, has a permanent right to reside, or has settled status, then pre-settled status would be acceptable up to 95% LTV.
  • We can accept sole or joint applications where both parties have pre-settled status up to a max LTV of 80%.
  • Applicants must have lived in the UK for at least 2 years. This can be verified through a credit search that shows their residency on the voter roll or through CAIS information. If neither of these checks can be completed, then we require documentary evidence of living in the UK and 6 months of bank statements.
  • Applicants also need to show proof of their settled or pre-settled status by providing a share code, which can be obtained from the Government's website. This code allows us to see their immigration status online.

    **Non-EEA Nationals:**

  • Non-EEA applicants can borrow up to 80% LTV, but applications up to 95% LTV may be considered on referral to underwriters via a Decision in Principle (DIP).

  • Applicants must have lived in the UK for at least 2 years. This can be verified through a credit search showing voter roll residency or via CAIS information. If neither check can be completed, documentary evidence of UK residency plus 6 months of bank statements is required.

  • Non-EEA nationals must provide evidence of Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) or Indefinite Leave to Enter the UK. This may be confirmed via a residency entitlement stamp in the passport/visa or written confirmation from the Home Office/UK Border Agency.

  • Non-EEA applicants without ILR will only be considered if they have at least 3 months remaining on a Skilled Worker or Health and Care Worker visa at the time of application.

  • Enquiries from applicants on a family (spousal) visa are acceptable, but only under the following conditions:

      o Joint applications only — Applicant 1 must have ILR, settled status, or British citizenship, Applicant 2 is the family visa holder.

      o The family visa holder must be the partner/spouse of Applicant 1.

      o Visa must have at least 3 months remaining at the time of application.

      o Visa holder must have at least 2 years of UK residency at the time of application.

      o If Applicant 2 is not the partner/spouse of Applicant 1, they may still be added to the mortgage application, but their income cannot be used.

## Help to Buy staircasing

Staircasing applications to enable part of the Help to Buy equity loan to be repaid are acceptable for remortgage and further advance applications up to a maximum loan to value of 80% (subject to product criteria). Staircasing must meet the standard Help to Buy criteria in addition to the following:

  • The minimum permitted staircasing amount is 10% of the current valuation. A valuation report instructed by ourselves is required in all instances to confirm the current valuation of the security property.
  • No additional funds can be used for other forms of debt consolidation/home improvements.
  • Prior to offer, we will need confirmation of the amount required to fully redeem the loan or to partially repay from target. We are unable to lend any funds above this figure.
  • Staircasing to 100%, this is no longer classed as a Help to Buy therefore please resubmit as a standard remortgage application.

---

## ID and residency requirements

The following information is required in support of a mortgage application:

  • The Society will initially attempt to identify all customers electronically by using software which checks a series of databases for identification information. This search does not affect your client's credit rating, however in some cases we may find it necessary to request paper identification to prove name and/or address. Where required, any documents can be provided using our document upload facility.
  • Applicants must supply proof of residence. Any utility bill, council tax bill, bank statements or mortgage statements are acceptable, provided confirmation sight of the original documents is supplied and they are from within the last 3 months.
  • The Society will be required to confirm identity. Acceptable documents include a passport or driving licence photocard.
  • Intermediaries are responsible for ensuring that applicant's identity and Proof of Residency are verified as part of the application process.
  • Applicants must normally have been resident in the United Kingdom for a minimum period of three years. This can be waived for members of the diplomatic corps, a member of HM Forces, or employees of internationally based companies, providing their family will be resident in the property.

---

## Income - future changes

Where a reduction in income is anticipated in the near future then the impact of this must be considered for affordability purposes. This would normally include applicants who are close to retirement, those that are on or due to go on maternity leave or those that are looking to reduce working hours.

    We would expect that any future changes to income are confirmed on the application we receive so that this can be taken into consideration by our underwriters.

    Where applicants are on or due to go onto paternal leave then we will require details of the date they are expected to return to work, the basis on which they will return (i.e. Part time / Full time) and the new salary on return to work. This will need to be verified by the applicants employer if they intend to return under different terms.

---

LMS provide conveyancing services to the Newcastle supporting the application process for broker customers. Where our products are offered on a fees assisted basis (where a fees assisted legal transfer is included in the features of the product) LMS will provide the conveyancing service. In addition LMS are also able to provide a low cost fee paying service. For details of the costs involved please refer to our conveyancing service page.

Should your client wish to use their own solicitor/conveyancing firm in the purchase or re-mortgage of their home, it is important to note that included in the Society's Panel Acceptance criteria is the requirement for multiple partners. Sole Practitioners are not accepted to our panel and any request will be rejected. Where sole practitioners are instructed they may act for your client however we will instruct LMS to act on behalf of the Society.

    In order to provide this service there will be an additional charge to your client and an outline of these costs can be found on Separate Representation (England and Wales).

    If the proposed conveyancing provider is declined a customer can select any other solicitor, including LMS appointed firms from the panel without incurring additional Society fees.

## Later life lending

### Lending into Retirement

    Lending into Retirement is where the Borrower is not retired at the point of loan origination, but there is a likelihood that retirement will occur whilst part of the loan is still outstanding.

    Where any element of the loan is on Interest Only, the maximum mortgage term will be based on the oldest applicant turning 80.

    Where the mortgage term extends into retirement (lower of either 70 or declared retirement age), the following will apply:

  • **Retirement is more than 10yrs away:**
Current income used for affordability purposes however, suitable evidence that the applicant is currently paying into a private/employer pension plan must be provided. This can include payslips evidencing pension contributions or a pension statement (latest annual statement must be provided).
  • **Retirement is less than 10yrs away:**
Affordability will be based on the lower of the current income or future pension income. Evidence of future pension income will need to be provided in the form of the latest annual pension statements showing projected figures.

    However, if the term takes the applicant beyond the age of 80, the following approach will be used to assess income (capital repayment only):

    If more than half of the mortgage term is before retirement age (70 or declared retirement age if lower), we will use their current earned income for affordability. Evidence that the applicant is currently paying into a private/employer pension plan will be required.

    If more than half of the mortgage term is after their retirement age (70 or declared retirement age if lower), we will require evidence of both current earned income and projected retirement income and affordability will be based on the lower figure.

    Alternatively, a Plan B approach can be considered where there is suitable justification to do so. This might include an understanding of the plan such as the below and we may seek to understand whether the timing of this could be brought forward should circumstances require:

  • Pensions/investments. Please note we can only consider the 25% tax free lump sum from self-invested personal pension.
  • Sale of another property. For example a buy to let or second home.
  • Downsizing of the mortgaged property. Please note we are only able to accept this as a suitable Plan B for an interest only mortgage and we may seek to understand whether the timing of this could be brought forward should circumstances require.

### Self-employed

Lending into retirement is assessed on a case-by-case basis and will depend on the nature of the business and the applicant's role within the business. Underwriters will need to be satisfied that the same level of income can continue to be generated later in life.

### Lending in Retirement

    Lending in retirement is where the borrower is retired at the point of loan origination.

    Affordability will be assessed solely on existing retirement income.

    Future changes to retirement income may also need to be considered and should income reduce then we would need to be able to demonstrate that the loan remains affordable throughout the term.

    The maximum mortgage term will be based on the oldest applicant turning 80 when any element of the loan is on Interest Only.

---

## Let to Buy

Let to Buy is where the borrower is not redeeming the mortgage held on their existing property and is looking to let this out whilst purchasing a new property as their main residence.

    Loans will be considered on the following basis:

  • We obtain consent to let from the existing lender or a copy of the new BTL offer.
  • We obtain evidence from 1 registered ARLA / NLA letting agent of expected rental income.
  • The expected rental income must pass our rental stress test. The rent must cover at least 145% based on the mortgage pay rate on an interest only basis or the 'loaded' monthly payment. If there is a shortfall, this needs to be added as a commitment.

    We will also consider applicants who are looking to remortgage a property already mortgaged to Newcastle Building Society onto one of our Buy to Let schemes and purchase a new residential property to be mortgaged to ourselves.

---

## Loan amounts

Minimum/maximum loan amounts are product specific.

## New build properties

A New Build property can be classed as **i)** a property being occupied for the first time in its current state **ii)** A refurbished property (existing residential unit(s) being occupied for the first time it in current state **iii)** A converted property (re-development of non-residential unit(s) to residential unit(s) being occupied for the first time in its current state.

    Maximum permitted LTV will be dependent on a) the presence of Builders Incentives and b) whether the property is a new build house or new build flat as follows:-

    The maximum starting ground rent on all new build properties with a leasehold tenure is limited to 0.1% of the property value.

    Ground rent must be reasonable at all times during the lease term. For example, ground rent escalation should be linked to RPI (Retail Price Index) or a similar index, and unreasonable multipliers of ground rent will not be permitted, for example doubling every 5, 10 or 15 years.

    **New Build Houses**

    The maximum loan to value for new build houses is 95%.

    The loan amount plus any deposit/cashback incentives and product fee will be capped at 95% which means the borrower will still need to contribute a deposit from their own resources.

    Where incentives exist, we allow up to 5% incentives including deposit contributions, cashbacks, legal costs, stamp duty without deductions from the purchase price. Costs that don't have a material impact on the value of the property such as white goods, carpets, curtains are not treated as incentives.

    **New Build Flats**

    The maximum loan to value for new build flats is 90%. 1 bed flats maximum 80%.

    The loan amount plus any deposit/cashback incentives and product fee will be capped at 90% which means the borrower will still need to contribute a deposit from their own resources.

    Where incentives exist, we allow up to 5% incentives including deposit contributions, cashbacks, legal costs, stamp duty without deductions from the purchase price. Costs that don't have a material impact on the value of the property such as white goods, carpets, curtains are not treated as incentives.

  • The UK Finance Disclosure form must be completed by the developer and presented to the valuer on site. If this is not seen a nil value is returned on the valuation form.
  • For LTV calculation purposes we will accept up to 5% of the purchase price for Builders Incentives.
  • For clarity, an incentive is defined as any cash or goods received from the builder or developer.

    All New Build properties must have a home warranty scheme applied. The acceptable schemes to the Society are:

  • NHBC
  • Build-Zone
  • LABC
  • Zurich Municipal
  • HAPM
  • Premier Guarantee
  • BLP
  • Protek
  • AHCI Advantage
  • ICW (International Construction Warranty)
  • Checkmate Castle 10

  • Aedis Homeproof New Build 10 Residential Warranty
  • Aedis Homeproof New Build 10 Residential Warranty for Self Build
  • Professional Consultants Certificate (only up to 15 dwellings in any development and retrospective PCCs not acceptable)

    Please note that we do not accept assignable contracts in any form.

    **New Build Variation – First Homes**

    First Homes are a new form of affordable housing, sold to first-time buyers at a discount of at least 30% against the market value that remains attached to the property in perpetuity. Local Authorities may choose to apply discounts up to 50%.

    After the discount has been applied, the first sale must be at a price no higher than £250,000 (or £420,000 in Greater London). First Homes will be for first-time buyers only, and councils will be able to prioritise them for local people and for key workers.

  • Max LTV 95% of discounted purchase price
  • Homes are purchased under a s106 agreement, which restricts the purchase to local first-time buyers
  • Homes will be sold at a typical discount of 30% below market price for this purchase. The same discount will apply to any subsequent sales
  • Authority to Proceed document will be required issued by the Local Authority
  • Further advances can be considered subject to usual LTV restrictions against the market value minus the applicable discount
  • Can support the subsequent purchase or remortgage of a First Homes property if LTV restrictions are applied to the appropriate discounted market valuation

    All other aspects follow the standard new build lending policy detailed above. Find more information on First Homes.

    We would not accept properties where the unexpired lease has less than 85 years remaining on completion.

    The tenure of acceptable properties will be freehold or leasehold in England and Wales, or their Scottish equivalent.

    All properties must be assessed by a suitably qualified valuer with sufficient professional indemnity cover. All valuation instructions (with exception of Scotland) will be made by the Society via our nominated panel. Third party instructions are not acceptable.

Replacement properties are now to be keyed as a new application. Once submitted, please call 0345 602 2338 in order for us to link to your previous application.

---

## Right to Buy

Loan must be on a repayment basis.

    We will consider lending 100% of the discounted purchase price as indicated in the offer agreement between tenant(s) and Local Authority / Housing Association.

    We will also consider lending additional funds up to a maximum of 80% LTV of open market value subject to funds being used solely for home improvements.

    It will be a requirement that estimates for the works to be carried out are received prior to us instructing the valuation. We will consider lending up to £5000 maximum upfront to fund immediate home improvements as long as any additional funds are retained until all works completed and a reinspection confirms.

    It will be a condition of the mortgage that any additional funds in excess of the discounted purchase price will still rank higher than the Local Authority's charge on the property.

    Under no circumstances will we lend additional funds for capital raising including payment of fees to any solicitor or third party.

    Only the applicants named on the Right to Buy offer agreement can be named on the mortgage.

    The Society's charge should always be registered as first priority ahead of any Local Authority.

The valuer must confirm that there is a ready and sustainable demand for the property to be mortgaged.

    Flats will be considered as long as adhere to current policy i.e. no high rise flats, maximum 5 storeys. Note that maximum LTV would be 75% of the open market as per our standard criteria for ex local authority flats.

    Further Advances will be considered subject to all funds must be used for home improvements within the discount period.



## Second homes

Second homes / holiday homes must be strictly for the sole use of the borrower and dependent family members and must not be let. The maximum loan to value for such properties is 75% and the applicant's financial status must be sufficient to cover both loans where we will deduct the applicant's main mortgage as a monthly commitment. Maximum loan is £500,000.

The most recent figures must be no more than 18 months old.
  • Self-employed applicants' income will be assessed as follows:

    Where profits have declined in the last 12 months, then we only use the most recent year to assess for affordability. We may also require a projection from the applicant's accountant to ensure that this trend is not continuing.

    Where net profit has declined in consecutive years or drawings continue to exceed net profit, then the application will be declined.
