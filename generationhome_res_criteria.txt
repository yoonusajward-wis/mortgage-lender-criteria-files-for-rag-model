We will attempt to verify the customer's address using the electoral roll in the first instance.

## Adoption allowance

Adoption allowance is acceptable and will be weighted at 100%. The allowance must be guaranteed.


## Adverse credit

All owners and income boosters are credit checked. A fully submitted mortgage application will leave a hard credit footprint.

Any individuals who are associated with the owner(s) through continuing linked finances, marriage, or civil partnerships should be added to the application. If the owner(s) prefers for these persons to not be included, they'll need to get independent legal advice. Proceeding in this arrangement is subject to underwriter discretion.

Each customer is subject to the same checks, whether contributing to the mortgage or not.


---

## Age

### Minimum age

At least one customer, including sole customers, must be aged over 21.

All remaining customers must be aged over 18.

### Maximum age

For sole customers the maximum age at the end of the term is 75.

For cases with more than one customer, the loan must be repaid by the eldest customer's 85th birthday.

We may be able to extend the term beyond an income booster's 85th birthday using our ejector seat. This will be applied automatically by our systems when calculating the maximum term.

All forms of tax credits are now paid as part of Universal Credit and can be found on the customer's Universal Credit monthly statement.

To be accepted, bonus income must be earned within the last 12 months. Key the full amount and we will apply a 50% weighting.

Only bonus income that has been evidenced will be used.

## Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)

Income through the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) can be considered if the customer has 12 months' continuous employment in the same line of work.

This can be from different companies and can be against previous or future guaranteed work. This income is weighted at 100%.

### Calculating Income

An average of the last 2 months' CIS payments should be declared, annualised over the full year.

The income should be in line with the contract, latest tax calculation or annual invoice schedule. Where there is a large discrepancy, a rationale should be provided.

### Packaging guidance

To verify income:

* 2 months' payslips or invoices

To verify 12 months continuous employment/income:

* Latest year's tax calculation and corresponding tax year overview (TYO), or
* Current contract, or

The outer skin will usually be of stone, brick or block. The roof will be of slate, tile, thatch or felt.

We may consider properties constructed using nonconventional methods but will be entirely guided by the valuer's comments and confirmation of the property being suitable security for mortgage purposes.

### Generally acceptable construction types include:

* Timber framed property with outer walls of brick or stone built 1970 or after

CCJs satisfied more than 3 years ago can be considered.


---

## Credit cards

See: [Credit commitments](#credit-commitments)

---

## Credit commitments
Where any of the owners or income boosters have current formal or informal commitments in place, the commitments must be disclosed following the logic below.

We use Experian data and personal bank statements to verify this information.

Where an instalment loan is present (e.g. a personal loan), the loan payment should be included as expenditure.

If a commitment has already been paid off or will be paid off before completion, it can be excluded when you key a decision in principle.

### Revolving credit

Where the customer is using a revolving credit facility – such as a credit card or overdraft for everyday transactions – and repays the balance in full each month, the commitment may be excluded where:

* The payment does not exceed the customer net monthly income
* The repayment is covered by income, not by drawing on savings or additional borrowing

This will be verified against the last 6 months payment history confirmed on Experian.

For any standing revolving credit facility balances, 3% of the balance will be included as an expense.


---

## Criminal convictions

The following policy applies where the customer or someone they are living with has a criminal record:

* convictions for fraud are not accepted
* convictions for minor traffic offences are accepted
* other convictions are accepted only if spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974

---

## Current value

We will lend on the lower of the purchase price or current market value as determined by a suitable valuation.

The only exception to the above is where the application is classed as a family concessionary purchase in which case we will lend against the market value.


---

## Customer verification

All customers are required to complete identity and address verification.


---

## Customers

We can accept applications with a maximum of 4 owners excluding income boosters and up to 6 customers in total including income boosters.

Any individuals who are associated with the owner(s) through continuing linked finances, marriage, or civil partnerships should be added to the application. If the owner(s) prefers for these persons to not be included, they'll need to get independent legal advice. Proceeding in this arrangement is subject to underwriter discretion.

Each customer is subject to the same checks, whether contributing to the mortgage or not.

There is no limit to the number of deposit boosters on an application.


---

## Day rate contracts

Day rate contractors' income will be calculated as follows:

Annual income = day rate x 5 working days x 46 weeks

Assessment will follow the same process as for fixed term contracts.


---

## Debt consolidation

The maximum LTV for debt consolidation is 80% with a maximum capital raise amount of £50,000.

Evidence to support the purpose of the loan may be required, considering the size and circumstance of the additional borrowing.

Debt consolidation is not available for interest-only applications

## Debt relief order

Deferred shares
Deferred shares are not accepted.

Dependents
A dependent is a person not named on the mortgage application but supported financially by a party to the mortgage.

All child and adult dependants must be keyed for all customers (both owners and income boosters).

---

## Deposit boosters

Visit the deposit booster page on our website for more information about the deposit booster proposition.

Deposit boosters help with the deposit in return for a protected financial interest in the property.

This is done through an interest-free loan or an equity loan. Loans can be converted into a gift at any time.

An interest-free loan is a straightforward loan – you get back what you put in.

With an equity loan, the booster's stake increases or decreases in line with the property value.

A booster's capital is ring fenced to preserve a first-time buyer's stamp duty status.

We provide the deposit booster legal agreement free of charge and manage the loan repayment.

There is no maximum number of deposit boosters for a mortgage application. Deposit boosters do not need to be UK residents, however, funds from the deposit booster must come from a UK-based bank account and be in the UK for 3 months prior to funds being released.

Deposit boosters must take independent legal advice (ILA) at their own cost before signing the deposit booster agreement.

Deposit boosters are not allowed to reside in the property.

### Requirements for a deposit booster:

* Contact details (phone number, email and full name)
* National Insurance number
* Date of birth
* Latest 3 years of address history
* Details regarding deposit contribution, including amount, source and terms (specifying interest-free or equity stake)
* Proof of identification and address

### Checks we carry out (KYC):

* Fraud
* PEP, sanction and media checks
* Address
* Identification
* Source of fund checks (where required)


---

## Deposit sources

The following types of deposit are acceptable:

* Savings
* Sale of property or equity release
* Sale of shares or cryptocurrency
* Inheritance
* Concessionary purchase
* Gifted deposit from a close relative

Where a third party is gifting any element of the deposit and plans to reside in the property, we will require them to get independent legal advice.

Unsecured loans are not accepted as a deposit.

Where deposit funds are coming from overseas, further due diligence checks will be applied.

Where deposit funds are the product of cryptocurrency trading, please refer to the acting conveyancer for further guidance on acceptability.

Our deposit booster proposition allows friends or family to make a contribution to the deposit in the form of an equity loan or interest-free loan.

Visit the deposit booster page on our website for more information.


---

## Direct Debit

We will collect all payments by Direct Debit.

We require sufficient Direct Debits to be setup to cover the CMI before we can approve the Certificate of Title.

The buying group (both owners and income boosters) decide how payments should be managed.

Disability Living Allowance (DLA)
Income from a Disability Living Allowance is accepted and weighted at 100%.

At least 50% of income required to support the loan must be from non-benefit income.

We allow Disabled Living Allowance (DLA) and Personal Independence Payments (PIP) for children, but this must be continuing for the next 5 years.


Benefit income

Discounted market sale
We will consider applications on the basis that there is no sign of distress or vulnerability.

Unless the application is a family concessionary purchase, we will only be able to lend against the lower of the purchase price or market valuation and we will require at least a 5% deposit to be provided. The difference between the purchase price and the market value cannot be considered for the deposit source.


Family concessionary purchase

EWS1
Where properties require an EWS1 form, the form should be signed and dated within 5 years of current date and the appropriate rating should be clearly stated.

We are lead by our valuers on whether or not a property requires an EWS1.


Cladding

Early repayment charges (ERCs)
Early repayment charges are payable if the customer repays the mortgage loan or switches to another product before the end of the initial interest rate. They are based on a percentage of the amount that the customer repays or switches. Early repayment charges will also apply if the overpayment allowance is exceeded.

Early repayment charges do not apply after expiry of the initial fixed rate period.

See sourcing systems for details of current ERCs.


Overpayments

Ejector seat
The ejector seat is only applicable to cases with income boosters.

Our ejector seat feature can be used to extend the term by removing income boosters part way through the term so they do not exceed our maximum age criteria. We do this by adding a condition to the mortgage. All boosters will be removed at the same time, when the first one exceeds our age criteria. Owners can choose to remove income boosters earlier by remortgaging, subject to passing affordability checks at that time.

We calculate how much of the loan will have been paid off by the time the income boosters exceed our age criteria, and use this to determine if the owners would be able to afford the remaining loan on their own at that point.

Please note that ejector seat does not always allow the term to be extended to our 40 year maximum. For an accurate term range please get a DIP or contact us.

## Income boosters

Income boosters can be used on both purchases and remortgages

We will factor income boosters' disposable income into our affordability calculations to increase the amount we can lend. Please note that we apply additional tests to make sure the owners are not excessively reliant on the boosters.

For the most accurate affordability figure please use our affordability calculator.

To preserve a first-time buyer’s stamp duty status, an income booster is not on the property deeds, but they are on the mortgage. This is structured like a Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor (JBSP) mortgage.

Income boosters are subject to the same credit checks, eligibility criteria, and evidence requirements as the owners, as detailed elsewhere in this guide. However, our ejector seat feature can be used to extend the term by removing boosters part way through the term so they do not exceed our maximum age criteria.

On mortgages up to and including 80% LTV, friends and family can act as income boosters.

On mortgages up to and including 95% LTV, only close relatives can act as income boosters.

If income boosters choose to contribute to the mortgage, this will be treated as a gift.

Income boosters must take independent legal advice (ILA) at their own cost.

Income boosters residing in the security

May reside in the security, subject to underwriter discretion and where they meet the following:

The income booster is not currently on the title (i.e. they cannot be the vendor or be removed via a transfer of equity)
The income booster is not also a deposit booster
The income booster is not providing a gift (This includes gifts towards deposit, legal fees and Stamp Duty Land Tax)
The income booster receiving mandatory ILA in relation to their occupancy (This is in addition to standard income booster ILA & must be carried out face-to-face)
Where the income booster is the customer's spouse or civil partner - a strong rationale must be provided prior to submission of the application - these will be considered on a case-by-case basis. The relationship status of 'other' must be selected.

Note that all customers, including income boosters, are liable for the full mortgage repayment.

Visit the income booster page on our website for more information about the income booster proposition.

Independent legal advice (ILA)
ILA (independent legal advice) is provided by a solicitor before the customer enters into a financial arrangement to ensure everyone is aware of their obligations, the risks involved, and rights regarding the transaction.

We require both income boosters and deposit boosters to obtain ILA. This is to ensure that they understand their legal obligations and responsibilities as a booster.

More information on this can be found here.

Within the last 3 months:

Mortgage: no account to have any arrears
Unsecured credit: no account to be more than 1 month in arrears
Revolving credit: no account to be more than 1 month in arrears
Any current arrears must be resolved prior to submission.

Within the last 2 years:

Mortgage: no account to be more than 1 month in arrears
Unsecured credit: no account to be more than 1 month in arrears unless the combined monthly payment is £100 or less and for no more than 3 months in arrears
Where any account is over 1 month in arrears, the monthly payments for all unsecured accounts in arrears – including those that are only 1 month overdue – are combined. The total of these combined payments must not exceed £100.

For example:

The customer currently has two loans that are in arrears. The first loan, with a monthly payment of £20, is 2 months overdue. The second loan, with a monthly payment of £90, is 1 month overdue. Together, these loans have a combined monthly payment obligation of £110, which exceeds policy limits and would therefore be considered outside of policy.

Revolving credit: no account to be more than 1 month in arrears unless the combined utilised balance is £500 or less and for no more than 3 months in arrears
Where any account is more than 1 month in arrears, the utilised balances of all revolving accounts in arrears—including those only 1 month overdue—are combined. The total of these combined balances must not exceed £500.

For example:

The customer currently holds two revolving credit accounts that are in arrears. The first account, a credit card with a utilised balance of £200, is 2 months overdue. The second account, a mail order credit with a utilised balance of £350, is 1 month overdue. Together, these accounts have a combined utilised balance of £550, which exceeds policy limits and would therefore be consider outside of policy.

Our mortgages are not portable.

Power lines
We do not accept properties where power lines or electricity supply apparatus are located directly over and/or on the site.

Previous BTL/HMO use
Previous BTL or HMO use is acceptable where:

the property is being purchased for residential use only,
positive valuer comments are received, and
any change of use agreements are completed on or before completion.

Probate
We do not accept applications on properties that are part of probate proceedings unless probate has been granted.

Probation periods
Customers in the first 6 months of employment are considered to be in a probationary period.

### Packaging guidance
Where a customer is within a probationary period, the following are required in additional to standard document requirements:

Confirmation that the customer is guaranteed to become permanently employed (e.g. contract or letter showing a completed probation period), or
12 months' track record within a similar role or profession, evidenced through contracts, bank statements, payslips, a P60 or tax calculation

Product switches
At the end of a fixed-rate period where there are no material changes to the mortgage, a product switch will be allowed without an affordability assessment.

Product switches are only available where there are no material changes to the loan. A full new remortgage application needs to be submitted if there are changes to term, changes to the customer group (including removing an income booster), or if additional borrowing is required.

The process to product switch an existing customer is quick and straightforward. To get started please log on to Gen H Pro and press 'product switch'. Additional documentation or assessment will not normally be required.

You should advise your client and help them to select a suitable new product. Details of current retention products are available via your sourcing system or on our website.

Customers in the following situations are not eligible for product switches:

Active consent to let
Renting a room to a lodger, except with our permission and where any conditions we impose continue to be met
Customers in arrears
In breach of our Terms & Conditions
Remaining mortgage term less than period of the new product
Mortgages offered under the Help to Buy scheme
Leasehold properties with less than 50 years left on the lease at the end of the mortgage term
A product switch can be initiated up to 180 days before the end of a customer's current product. Once you've selected a new rate, you can swap for a different one or cancel the switch altogether up until 5 working days before the end of the current product.

Proof of deposit
If any of the funds being used for the deposit have been gifted to the owner(s), we will require a gifted deposit letter to be completed by the gifter.

Any other proof of deposit documentation is only required when requested. The acting conveyancer will always complete thorough checks in regards to the deposit funds.

Where the deposit funds are coming from overseas, documentation will be required and further due diligence checks will be applied.

Where the funds are being received from a high risk country, we may choose not to proceed.

Where the deposit funds are the product of cryptocurrency trading, please refer to the acting conveyancer for further guidance on acceptability.

Other charges, such as rent charges, will be reviewed on a case by case basis and should be entered under “other”.

The valuer will always be asked to confirm whether the annual property charges would affect property suitability and marketability as part of the mortgage valuation.

Where we are advised of an impact, we may choose not to proceed.

Rental income
Rental income at Gen H is assessed based on the gross rental income (after any management fees), with a 17% deduction for rental voids and expenses. The full mortgage commitment must be entered.

Where there are other associated costs relating to the property, such as management fees, they must also be declared or offset against the income.

Enter the full amount, and the system will apply the appropriate weighting to the income.

Since the income figure is internally generated, all rental income is reviewed by an underwriter to ensure it is reasonable and achievable. Underwriters have the discretion to request tax returns as evidence of declared rental profit and may adjust the income figure calculated by the system if appropriate.

All rental income derived from short-term lets (under six months), holiday lets, or irregular rental income must align with the latest tax return unless a suitable explanation and, where applicable, supporting evidence is provided to justify a higher figure. It is recommended that any applications including rental income from these sources are referred to Gen H before submission.

We will require the following for each of the rental properties:

Address of property
Outstanding mortgage balance
Total annual rental income
Total annual mortgage repayment
### Packaging guidance

Interest only

Retentions
Any retention up to £5,000 – subject to the valuer’s comments – will be acceptable, and the case will be allowed to proceed to full drawdown.

We won’t lend on properties where the valuer recommends a retention of more than £5,000.

Retirement age / plans
We can accept applications where all customers are already retired or are due to retire within the term of the loan.

Planned retirement age must be keyed and cannot exceed 75.

Underwriters will assess whether the planned retirement age is reasonable for the line of work, e.g. in the case of physically demanding roles.

The following list provides generally accepted guidelines; however, it is not exhaustive, as underwriters have final discretion:

Clerical/office-based roles: acceptable up to age 75
Retail-Based Roles: acceptable up to age 75
Self-employed Customers with employees: acceptable up to age 75
Physically demanding roles (e.g., tradesmen, ground workers, firefighters) or roles requiring physical capability (e.g., drivers, pilots, hair and beauty professionals) additional justification will be required for us to consider using the income past the age of 70
Professional sportspeople are assessed on a case-by-case basis - please refer to Gen H prior to submission.

If a customer is already retired, the relevant pension income fields should be completed.

Please ensure that any additional retirement income, such as rental or investment income (excluding pensions), is also entered in the appropriate fields.

### Packaging guidance
For a private pension:

Retirement within 10 years

If a customer is retiring within the next 10 years, their expected retirement income must be recorded. For affordability calculations, we will use the lower of either their expected retirement income or current income.

The expected retirement income should include all income received after retirement age, adjusted to the appropriately weighted amount.

Please ensure that any additional retirement income, such as rental or investment income (excluding pensions), is also entered in the appropriate fields.

### Packaging guidance
Evidence of pension such as an annual statement, latest pension projection and/or SIPP valuation

Retiring between 10 and 15 years with loan extending over 5 years into retirement

If a customer is retiring within 10 to 15 years and the loan extends more than five years into their retirement, only their current income needs to be recorded. However, we will require both clarification and appropriate evidence to demonstrate their ability to maintain the loan in retirement.

Unlike cases where retirement is within 10 years, we will not assess a specific income value but must be satisfied that sufficient provisions are in place to support the loan throughout retirement.

### Packaging guidance
Evidence of pension such as an annual statement, latest pension projection and/or SIPP valuation

Retiring between 10 and 15 years with loan extending less than 5 years into retirement OR retiring in over 15 years

If a customer is retiring within 10 to 15 years, but the loan extends less than five years into retirement, or if they are retiring in more than 15 years, we will require evidence that they are making contributions to a pension beyond the State Pension.

Alternatively, evidence of rental or investment income will also be sufficient to meet this requirement. If this has already been recorded, no further evidence will be required.

Have a shareholding of 20% or more in a limited company. This is the combined shareholding of all customers on the mortgage application who are associated with the same business.
We require proof of the latest 2 years’ trading for all self-employed customers, but we use the latest year’s accounts for our affordability assessment.

Where a customer has been trading for more than 1 year, but less than 2, we can still consider the application subject to evidence being provided of a track record of previous employment at a similar level of income in a similar line of work. E.g. a customer who works as a plumber with a 2024 tax return showing £60,000 and a 2023 P60 showing an income of £50,000.

Where the trading has reduced, we will reduce the income accordingly.

Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT)
Married Applicants and Stamp Duty Land Tax(SDLT)

Married couples are treated as a single unit for SDLT purposes, even if only one person applies for the mortgage.
If the non-applicant spouse owns a property, the higher rate of SDLT for second homes will still apply.
First-Time Buyer (FTB) status may also be affected if the spouse previously owned a property.
Our Lending Approach

We do allow married applicants to apply individually; however, this should not be seen as a way to avoid stamp duty obligations.
Our lending decisions do not take stamp duty considerations into account, apart from affordability assessments.
Role of the Conveyancer

The conveyancer is legally obliged to ensure that the correct SDLT is paid. Any discrepancies made known to the conveyancer, including attempts to avoid SDLT, should be addressed during the conveyancing process.
Advising Customers

Please encourage customers to seek professional tax advice regarding SDLT obligations as we cannot provide them with any tax advice.
It is important to inform customers that they must have sufficient funds to meet any SDLT liabilities.
Why This Matters

Our aim is to support complex customer needs while ensuring compliance with all relevant regulations. These clarifications are intended to keep brokers and customers well-informed, enabling us to continue providing an excellent service without facilitating or implying support for stamp duty avoidance. We always recommend that you seek advice from a suitably qualified tax adviser before taking any action. The information above only serves as a guide and no responsibility for loss occasioned by any person acting or refraining from action as a result of this material can be accepted by Gen H.

Disclaimer: This information reflects our understanding only and should not be considered tax advice. We strongly recommend that all customers seek independent tax advice regarding their purchase.

Statutory sick pay
We don’t accept statutory sick pay.

Stipend
We accept stipend income from members of the clergy.

In these circumstances, the stipend income can be included on the basis that it is lower than future employed income.

Student loan repayments
Student loan repayments should only be included where they are currently being repaid. Where the customer’s annual income does not meet the minimum threshold to begin repaying, it should not be included.

Students
We will consider applications where one or more of the customers is a student.

We will only accept stipend income where a future contract of employment can be evidenced or where received long-term as a member of the clergy.

We will not consider bursaries, student loans or grants as part of their income.

Self employed

Employed income

Unencumbered property
We allow capital raising on unencumbered properties that have been owned for a minimum of 6 months and are registered at the Land Registry.

In such a case, the max LTV is 80%.

For remortgage cases where the property is either unencumbered or inherited property, proof of property ownership must be obtained.

Unilateral notice
We do not lend where a property has a unilateral notice on it unless this is removed upon completion.

## Uninhabitable properties

For a property to be considered an acceptable security for mortgage lending, it must be structurally sound and secure, easy to appraise and immediately habitable as a residential property.

The definition of habitable requires the property to be capable of being lived in with relative comfort. The property must:

Be wind and weather tight.
Be plastered out
Have all services functioning and connected, and a kitchen with:
Functioning hot and cold-water supply to a sink
Adequate food preparation and storage facilities
Have a functioning bathroom with bath or shower and WC, and
The inspecting valuer must not have commented that the property in its current condition is deemed uninhabitable.

Latest month’s bank statement
How to Calculate Benefits Using a Universal Credit Statement

Identify the net payment: Start with the monthly net payment shown on the statement
Deduct housing benefit: Subtract the housing benefit from the net payment
Deduct benefit for children: We will accept benefits for children that are no older than 13 years of age at the point of application. If the children are older, then this must be deducted
Check the net pay declared against the application income: Adjust benefits where the income level declared on the Universal Credit statement is less than the level of income used for affordability purposes
Scenario Summary

Universal Credit Entitlements

Standard Allowance: £393.45 (for a single individual)
Housing: £725.00 (total rent covered)
Children: £621.25 (support for two children age below 13)
Total Entitlement Before Deductions: £1,739.70
Deductions

Income deduction: £707.84 - based on a monthly income of £1,697.98 where the first £411 is ignored and every subsequent £1 reduces Universal Credit by £0.55 -- PLEASE NOTE For applicants with variable income (e.g., self-employment), one month of the total income must be used to accurately calculate the reduction. For example, if an applicant has £20,000 in self-employed income and £10,000 in employed income, the monthly income used for the calculation would be £2,500 (£30,000 ÷ 12)
Total Net Payment for This Month: £1,031.86
Steps to Calculate Benefit

Net Payment: £1,031.86
Deduct Housing Benefit: £1,031.86 − £725.00 = £306.86
Deduct Child Benefits (if applicable): In this scenario, the children are under 13 years and therefore no deduction is applied
Annualise the Benefit: £432.41 x 12 = £3,682.32
Based on this scenario, the annualised net benefit (after housing and any applicable child deductions) is £3,682.32.

If applicants have recently experienced a significant change in their circumstances, it is recommended to use an online calculator to accurately determine their current entitlement. Suitable options can be found on the government website here.

Unsociable hours
Income from working unsociable hours is acceptable but must be guaranteed. It is weighted at 100%.

Valuations
A mortgage valuation is conducted on all applications to ensure the property is a suitable security. Completion of the loan must take place within 7 months of the original valuation date.

For valuation fees (if applicable), see the product details in your sourcing system.

Visas
We require every customer to possess a valid visa that confers the right to reside and be employed in the UK. We do not operate a prescribed list of acceptable visa types.

Certain visa categories, such as student visas (previously Tier 4), which stipulate limitations on working hours, may be considered for acceptance following a case-by-case review.

Where a customer holds a Skilled Worker visa, acceptance is contingent upon their employment being in a field relevant to the visa requirements, thereby enabling the customer to renew or extend their visa beyond its initial expiry.

## Voluntary Right to Buy

We won’t lend on applications using Voluntary Right to Buy.

## Vulnerable customers

According to 2022 research from the FCA, almost half of the UK’s population is vulnerable to potential harm with overrepresentation in certain groups, such as women and people on lower incomes.

That’s why it’s so important you tell us if your clients possess any characteristics of vulnerability.

Disclosing a vulnerability to potential harm won’t have any impact on the kinds of products we’re able to offer them. And the more we know about a client’s circumstances, the better we can tailor our service.

Whether they’re going through a huge life change, they’re not so good with numbers, or they have an illness or physical attribute that could impact how they interact with us, we’d like to know.

You can make a disclosure on the “Vulnerability details” page of your applications or by getting in touch with us directly at broker@generationhome.com or on 0330 808 1791.
