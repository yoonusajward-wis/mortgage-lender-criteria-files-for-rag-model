We do not accept applications where we consider the applicant to be a portfolio landlord

We do not accept applications for Commercial Buy to Let

Applications from UK residents must have at least one applicant with a minimum basic income of £25,000 per year (excluding rental income). 60% of variable income is now accepted towards minimum income requirements.

Key the application using only basic income, if variable income is required to support affordability, please contact our Broker Support Helpdesk to add this on. [https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/broker-support/]

For applications with one or more non-UK residents (these will be treated as an International BTL application), at least one applicant must evidence a minimum basic income of £75,000. Variable income is not accepted for non-UK residents.

For applications from UK residents (not an International BTL application), at least one applicant must be an owner occupier of a residential property for a minimum of six months, either owned outright or subject to an existing residential mortgage.

If the property is unencumbered, clear notes should be added to the application to confirm the customers owner occupier status

### Foreign nationals

Please note that this policy also applies to a joint application where one or both customer(s) is a foreign national.

Customers will be required to provide evidence of their status under the Settlement Scheme to support their mortgage application. This can be obtained from the GOV.UK website. [https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families]

Please provide the customers share code in the notes section of the application, as we will require this to complete the assessment.

Please choose the option 'Prove my immigration status' (do not use 'Prove my right to work')

The EU settlement scheme provides two statuses:

Applications from foreign nationals with diplomatic immunity are outside policy and should be declined. This does not apply to internal transfers/ additional borrowing requests where we already hold the existing security.

For customers without Indefinite Leave to Remain, Indefinite Leave to Enter, Right of Abode or no Pre-settled status, we will process applications if they meet our foreign criteria as detailed below:

### Portfolio landlords

The bank does not provide Buy to Let mortgage facilities where it has been evidenced that a customer is a Portfolio Landlord.

A Portfolio Landlord is a person(s) with:

Four or more Buy to let UK mortgaged properties in aggregate* at the end of the application

Purchase applications will be acceptable if the customer currently has no more than 2 Buy to Let mortgaged properties.

Non-purchase applications will be acceptable if the customer currently has no more than 3 Buy to Let mortgaged properties.

*Please note, for joint applications the 'aggregate' would be the combined number of BTL's held by both applicants on the mortgage.

This includes properties owned via a Limited Company or Holding Company.

The maximum Buy to let lending held with HSBC UK is capped at £2m.

### Tenant

HSBC accepts all tenant types except where the tenant is related to the landlord as we do not provide regulated mortgages in this respect.

The tenant must be an individual, and Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) for example student lets, holiday lets and sub-letting are all excluded.

### Type of buy to let property

We define a Consumer Buy to Let as:

A property that wasn't / isn't being initially purchased for a specific purpose of renting (e.g previous home / inherited property / accidental landlord)

We define an Investment Buy to Let as:

A property that is being purchased / was originally purchased for the specific purposes of renting.

## Borrowing

### Affordability

#### Affordability Assessment - Interest Only and Capital Repayment

Top Slicing applications can be submitted without completing an Income Cover Ratio (ICR) assessment, however we recommend our Buy to let calculatorExt is used in the first instance to assess whether Top Slicing is required to meet affordability. [https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/calculators/]

In addition to rental income coverage, we will assess personal income when making a lending decision.

Consideration will be given to your customer's personal commitments so to ensure that the lending remains sustainable in the event of tenancy voids, or where maintenance/repair costs have been incurred.

The application may be declined if we determine that there is insufficient disposable income to support the borrowing, or if the overall exposure is too high.

Any applications which do not meet affordability criteria using rental income only, can be assessed using Top Slicing policy (where the applicant is a higher rate taxpayer).

#### Income Cover Ratio (ICR) assessment

For basic rate tax payers, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 125% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher. This takes into account potential future interest rate rises.

Please note that when working out whether a basic or high rate taxpayer, total income should be considered. This should include rental income that is currently being received along with 75% of any proposed new property rental income (if a BTL Purchase application).

For higher rate tax payers, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 145% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher.

For joint applicants, both applicants need to be a basic rate tax payer to achieve a stressed rate of 125%, otherwise 145% will be applied if one applicant is a basic rate tax payer and the other applicant a higher rate tax payer.

For applications from non-UK residents, we will assess affordability based on the annual rental income, which must be equal to or greater than 145% of the annual Buy to Let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher.

A further check is also required to ensure that the rental payment is sufficient to cover the mortgage payment on a capital repayment basis.

#### Top Slicing

Top Slicing assessment (higher rate taxpayers only) – Domestic Buy to let applications only (not available for Let to buy or international Buy to let applications):

Minimum income requirement of £50,000 p.a. (excluding rental income). At least one applicant must meet this criteria

Maximum of 75% LTV

Annual rental income must be equal to or greater than 110% of the annual Buy to let mortgage payments, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate, whichever is higher

A further check will be made to ensure that the rental payment is sufficient to cover the mortgage payment

Personal disposable income can be used in addition to rental income to make up the shortall to 145% (background rental income cannot be used in the disposable income calculation)

For any background Buy to let properties that are owned, the overall rental income (for the background properties) must be 145% of the background mortgage payments (using stress rate of 5.5%)

Where the applicant is less than 5 years from their anticipated retirement age or age 70 (whichever is sooner), the annual rental income must be equal to or greater than 140% of the interest only element of the annual BTL mortgage payment, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate whichever is higher.

Where the applicant is less than 10 years from their anticipated retirement age or age 70 (whichever is sooner), the annual rental income must be equal to or greater than 125% of the interest only element of the annual BTL mortgage payment, calculated at the stressed rate or product rate whichever is higher.

#### Stressed Rate

Buy to Let stressed rate is currently:

Loan type | UK Residents LTV 75% or less | UK Residents Over 75% LTV | Non-UK Residents

All applications on a 5 year fixed rate | Product Rate + 1% or 4.9% (whichever is higher) | Product Rate + 1.15% or 5.7% (whichever is higher) | Product Rate + 1.05% or 5.35% (whichever is higher)

Like for like remortgage on a 2 year fixed rate | Product Rate + 1.1% or 5.05% (whichever is higher) | Product Rate + 1.25% or 6.15% (whichever is higher) | Product Rate + 1.15% or 5.55% (whichever is higher)

All other applications on a 2 year fixed rate | Product Rate + 2% or 5.5% (whichever is higher) | Product Rate + 2% or 6.15% (whichever is higher) | Product Rate + 2% or 5.55% (whichever is higher)

All applications on a Tracker rate | Product Rate + 2% or 5.9% (whichever is higher) | N/A | Product Rate + 2% or 6.35% (whichever is higher)

Please refer to the Buy to Let calculatorExt which will provide guidance as to whether the rental income is sufficient coverage for a full mortgage application. [https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/calculators/]

A Professional Valuation is mandatory for all Buy to Let applications, which will be used to confirm the expected monthly rental income and the demand for rental property in the specified location.

### Let to buy

We will accept applications to convert a UK residential mortgage, held with another UK lender, to an HSBC UK Buy to Let mortgage via our Let to buy journey.

Let to buy exclusions:

Not available for Unencumbered properties

Top Slicing not permitted.

Let to buy mortgages are available to applicant(s) seeking to remortgage their existing residential property to a Buy to Let mortgage, for the purpose of purchasing another residential property.

The current UK residential mortgage must be held with another lender not HSBC UK.

Let to buy affordability criteria is the same as Buy to Let criteria.

It is essential that Let to buy applications are keyed correctly by selecting 'Let to buy' as the 'Nature of Loan' on the Broker platform. Any cases keyed incorrectly as Buy to Let, will need to be rekeyed.

For all Let to buy applications there is a requirement to provide evidence of the new Residential mortgage payment. For example, a quotation, a Decision/Agreement in Principle, or a Mortgage Offer document where this amount is shown.

If the onward Residential purchase is being submitted with HSBC UK, please add notes on both Let to buy and Residential applications to advise they are linked. There is no specific order in which these applications need to be keyed/submitted, but we would expect both applications to be completed at a similar time to be able to cross reference.

Please ensure that you have correctly included the new Let to buy mortgage payment in the onward Residential purchase application. Do not duplicate the existing Residential mortgage payment that will cease once the new Let to buy mortgage is in place.

We will not treat the onward residential as a Second property where the current residential property is being converted to a Let to buy, therefore it is not subject to the 80% LTV cap (standard LTV limits apply).

The future rental income from the Let to buy can also be utilised within the onward Residential purchase application. Please note this does not apply to unencumbered properties.

This can be evidenced from the valuation report if the Let to buy application is with HSBC UK, or a letter from the Association of Rental Letting Agents (ARLA) if the Let to buy application is with another lender.

## Income

For sole applications from UK residents, the minimum basic income is £25,000 p.a. (this can include variable income but would exclude rental and benefit income). For overseas customers, the minimum basic income is £75,000 p.a. (excluding variable and rental income).

For joint applications, at least one applicant must meet this criteria.

Please key the application only using basic income. If variable income is required to support affordability, please contact the Broker Support Helpdesk to add this to the application. [https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/broker-support/]

Evidence of employed and variable income must be provided in line with the Residential lending criteria. [https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/criteria/?tab=residential]

For self-employed applications pleased provide the Latest years finalised accounts or Latest years Tax Calculation* and corresponding Tax Year Overview

*Tax Calculation can be an online print out from HMRC website, an SA302 or the computation produced by the customer's accountant using commercial software and submitted to HMRC. [https://www.gov.uk/log-in-file-self-assessment-tax-return]

Please note, for Limited Company Directors with a shareholding of 25% or more, we will require the most recent finalised financial accounts, the latest of which must be dated within the last 18 months.

For income in a foreign currency other than GBP, the amount should be converted using an appropriate currency conversion tool and input the gross income in GBP into the application.

All existing Buy to Let rental income will be verified for new Buy to Let applications using the latest months bank statement or latest years' SA100/SA105.

## Product

### Energy Efficient Homes

EEH products are available for Purchase and Remortgage applications up to £2million, and where the property has an Energy Performance Certificate rating of A or B.

Please refer to the product finder for our current range. [https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/products/]

To check an EPC rating, please refer to the Government website: find an energy certificate. [https://www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate]

A PEA rated property will be a new build property, PEA certificates are provided by the Developer.

If the PEA certificate has limited address information please also provide the Plot Reservation form for the property (also provided by the Developer).

### Loan

**Minimum loan**

For Buy to Let mortgages, the minimum loan is £25,000

For Buy to Let Additional Borrowing applications, the minimum loan is £10,000

**Maximum loan**

For Buy to Let mortgages and Additional Borrowing applications, the maximum loan amount is restricted by the following LTV (Interest Only and Capital Repayment):

Application Type | Loan Type / Size | LTV percent

Mortgage / Home Loan | Capital Repayment / Interest Only |

Up to and including £400k (only applicable on properties with an EPC rating of A-C) | 80

Up to and including £1m | 75

Up to and including £2m | 60

Up to £50k (Home loan for debt consolidation) | 60

The LTV is calculated using either the purchase price or the Professional Valuation of the property, whichever is lower.

HSBC UK accepts financial incentives up to 5% of the purchase price without impacting the LTV.

Any amount above 5% must be deducted from the purchase price.

Non-financial incentives do not need to be deducted from the purchase price and will not impact the LTV.

The total lending on Buy to Let mortgaged properties should not exceed £2m across all lenders.

For HSBC UK Intermediary applications, capitalised product fees are not included in the LTV calculation.

This means that the fee can be added to the loan and exceed the LTV loan size threshold, provided it does not exceed a maximum of 80% LTV

### Repayment type

Buy to Let mortgages are available on either a capital repayment or an interest-only basis.

We accept sale of the BTL property as a repayment plan.

For further information on other repayment strategies see Interest Only Repayment Plans. [https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/criteria/?tab=buy-to-let]

### Standard variable rate

The HSBC UK Standard Variable Rate is currently 7.50%

### Term

For all applications (including Additional borrowing and Unencumbered) on both Interest Only and Capital Repayment, the minimum mortgage term is 5 years (60 months) and the maximum term is 40 years (480 months).

## Property

### Buy to let vacant possession

**Remortgage applications**

For Buy to let Remortgage applications, the property can be either vacant or tenanted at the time of application. Where the property is already subject to an existing tenancy, which will remain in place following completion, we will lend where the tenancy is an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (England) a Standard Contract (Wales) or on a non-rent controlled tenancy (Northern Ireland) Or is a private residential tenancy for properties located in Scotland and meets the following criteria:

The tenant must be an individual (by definition in the FCA handbook)

The property must be occupied as the tenant's principal home

The tenancy must be dated on or after 28 February 1997 and must not be one that can become an Assured Tenancy.

**Purchase applications**

For Buy to let Purchase applications, vacant possession is required.

### Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)

A valid and up-to-date Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) is required for all properties with a minimum acceptable rating of 'E' and above. A rating of 'F' or 'G' will deem the property unsuitable for mortgage lending.

Where the LTV is over 75%, a valid and up-to-date Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) is required for all properties with a minimum acceptable rating of 'C' and above.

### Property types

For criteria on specific property types, please see the residential criteria section. [https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/criteria/?tab=buy-to-let]

### Security

**First legal charge**

A first legal charge (in Scotland, a first ranking standard security) over the property is/will be held. We do not provide second charge (second ranking) mortgages.

**Purchase applications**

For Buy to Let purchase applications, we require the property to have vacant possession.

### Insurance

Buildings insurance for a minimum of the full reinstatement value must be taken out or be held and remain in place during the term of the mortgage.

### Tenancy types

The property must only be let under an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (England) a Standard Contract (Wales) or on a non-rent controlled tenancy (Northern Ireland) where the rental income is less than or equal to GBP100,000 per annum for a maximum period of three years, or a company let agreement for a maximum period of 12 months.

Properties located in Scotland can be let under a private residential tenancy.

Company let agreements are acceptable in England and Wales, but not acceptable for properties located in Scotland (regardless of where the company is incorporated).

Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) for example student lets, holiday lets and sub-letting are all excluded.

In the case of a Buy to Let purchase the property must have vacant possession.

All Buy to Let leasehold properties must have more than 35 years remaining after completion of term of the mortgage. If this criteria is met, however the unexpired term at the outset has less than 85 years remaining, this will always be subject to the valuer's opinion. The valuer must be satisfied that there is a market for any property taking the lease term into consideration.

For more details refer to the Property section of our Residential lending criteria. [https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/criteria/?tab=residential]

### Tenure

All Buy to Let leasehold properties must have more than 50 years remaining after completion of term of the mortgage. If this criteria is met, however the unexpired term at the outset has less than 85 years remaining, this will always be subject to the valuer's opinion.

All valuations and mortgage offers are valid for 6 months.

The minimum acceptable property valuation amount is £75,000

The property must have a minimum Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) of E or above to be acceptable for mortgage lending. The energy rating will be determined during the property valuation.

**Down valued property value**

Where a property is down valued, an appeal can be raised if the figure provided by the valuer is lower than the expected property value by 20% or more, and the LTV, rate or lending amount has been impacted.

E.g. Expected purchase price is £100k but the physical valuation returns a figure of £80k. If the property down valuation does not fall within the 20% tolerance, an appeal cannot be raised.

The appeal must be received in a written format and all minimum criteria detailed below is mandatory. If the criteria is not fulfilled the appeal will not be progressed.

Unacceptable Evidence:

Estate Agents Market appraisal/opinion - this is an Estate Agents personal opinion of what they could market the property for, there is no obligation or guarantee that the figure will be achieved as a realised sale

Independent survey - this is completed for the customer's own purposes and doesn't take into consideration the bank's Policies and Lending Criteria

Properties that are currently on the market or sold subject to contract - until a sale is complete, they are not considered as suitable evidence

Please note that a valuation is carried out for the banks mortgage lending purposes only.

If an acceptable Managed Desktop Valuation (MDV) has been completed which is suitable for our lending purposes, even if the property has been valued less than expected, a Physical Valuation (PV) will not be undertaken.

We will only complete a subsequent Physical Valuation (PV) if the property has been valued less than expected, and it affects the amount of lending and/or the LTV rates available.

**Down valued rental income**

An appeal can be raised if the rental figure provided by the valuer is lower than the expected rental income by 20% or more and there is an effect on the amount of borrowing or LTV interest rate.

The appeal must be received in a written format and all minimum criteria detailed below is mandatory. If the criteria is not fulfilled, the appeal will not be progressed.

Minimum Accepted Criteria:

Evidence of a least 3 unfurnished properties rented out at the time of the valuation, similar to and in the locality of the subject property.

A customer having an existing or prospective tenant who has agreed to pay more than the local average, cannot be accepted as comparable evidence, as this is not a true reflection of the local rental market. HSBC UK will only use the valuation provided by the surveyor to make a risk based lending decision, we will not rely on rent agreed by a specific tenant.

## Existing borrowers

### Deceased Customers

**Product Switch** - If a joint mortgage where one of the parties has passed away, you are able to complete a product switch for the remaining customer who is the surviving borrower, while the mortgage is still in joint names.

Please ensure that the customer has already notified HSBC UK Mortgage Service Centre of their deceased partner.

### Overpayments

Access our calculators to find out how a regular or lump sum overpayment could reduce the term and interest paid on the mortgage. [https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/calculators/]

Lump sum and overpayments can be made at any time to our lifetime tracker mortgages.

Our fixed rate and discount mortgages have an annual overpayment allowance equivalent to 10% of the principal mortgage balance at drawdown, or at the start of a new rate switch.

Overpayments can be made by lump sum reductions and/or additional ad-hoc payments credited direct to the mortgage.

The monthly payments will remain the same unless the customer asks us to recalculate them on their reduced mortgage balance.

Alternatively, the customer can set up a flexible overpayment arrangement.

If they choose this method, we will collect the overpayment in with the existing direct debit payment.

The arrangement can be set up for a specific period or until further notice, your customer will need to make sure the monthly overpayments will not exceed their annual allowance in any one period.

When the current rate changes, the customer will need to review the arrangement again as the standard monthly payments and allowance will be reset.

At the end of the flexible overpayment arrangement the standard monthly payments will automatically be reset.

This is the same if there is a change to the monthly payment date, rate or an amendment to the overpayment arrangement to a different amount.

The recalculation will take into account previous overpayments, as it is calculated on the principal mortgage balance, the current interest rate and the remaining mortgage term.

If a new flexible overpayment arrangement is put in place, or when the current overpayment arrangement ends, the bank will acknowledge this with a letter to the customers to confirm the new payments being collected.

The overpayment allowance is reset annually on the anniversary of the drawdown, or at the start of the new rate following a switch.

If your customer switches rates before this anniversary date, a new overpayment will commence from the date the new rate begins and will be calculated by using 10% of the mortgage balance at this time.

An overpayment allowance is not transferable to the next overpayment period, therefore any allowance not utilised will be forfeited.

The Early Repayment Charge (ERC) will only be applied to the mortgage if the customer was to exceed the overpayment allowance in any one annual period.

This applies to an overpayment made by lump sum payments, ad-hoc payments or on a monthly overpayment arrangement.

We cannot amend or set up the overpayment arrangement if the mortgage is in the billing cycle, this means 5 working days prior to the monthly mortgage payment being collected.

If you wish to cancel this arrangement, you will need to do so at least 7 working days before the payment is due.

By making overpayments, the customer will benefit from an interest saving immediately as interest is charged daily.

The term of the mortgage may be reduced which can result in the loan being repaid earlier.

This will only be achieved if overpayments are continually made throughout the original mortgage term.

If monthly payments are reset, they are calculated over the original mortgage term/remaining term.

Any projected savings as a result of overpayments are subject to change.

The projections are not guaranteed as they are based on the current interest rate, the overpayments against the existing monthly payments, and the remaining term.

All of these factors will change.

Any changes to the interest rate, payment date, or if the overpayment arrangement stops will result in the standard payments being recalculated over the original term.

We will revert to a standard monthly payment (minimum payment) following these changes.

If the annual overpayment allowance is set in a leap year, the allowance will not commence on drawdown or amendment, and will instead reset the following working day.

Online banking customers can view their overpayment allowance by using the overpayment screen on their mortgage account.

This shows the annual allowance amount, the start and end dates for the current period and the allowance balance remaining if overpayments have been paid.
