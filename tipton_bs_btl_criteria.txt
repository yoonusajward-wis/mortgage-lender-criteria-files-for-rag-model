## Affordability Assessment

Affordability is calculated against the minimum rental cover and other policy requirements detailed within this document. In the circumstance an application has not progressed to mortgage offer within 90 days, affordability must be reassessed on our current Buy to Let Variable Rate (BTLVR).

## Arrangement To Pay

Arrangements to pay which have been repaid over 3 months prior to application will be accepted subject to individual case assessment. Arrangements to pay which have been repaid within the last 3 months will be considered on an individual basis.

## Consumer Buy To Let (Cbtl)

For us to accept a purchase application and not be considered a CBTL, the applicant(s) or their relative(s) must not intend to live in the property now or in the future. If it is a remortgage application and for us not to consider it to be a CBTL, the applicant(s) or their relative(s) must not intend to live in the property now or in the future and they must also have at least one other BTL property in the background.

## County Court Judgement (Ccjs)

One CCJ registered within three years and satisfied over three months prior to application can be considered on an individual basis and requires Lending Committee approval, where the total value does not exceed £500. Up to three CCJs per application registered and satisfied over three years prior to application can be considered on an individual basis, where the total value does not exceed £500. Up to three CCJs per application registered within three years and satisfied over three months prior to application can be considered on an individual basis and requires Lending Committee approval, where the total value exceeds £500.

## Deposit

To support the underwriting assessment, an explanation of the source of funds will be required, including originating country, and how the funds have been raised (i.e. savings, or sale of assets); Equity; or Sales at under value (Concessionary Purchase). Directors Loans for Limited Company BTLs These are considered acceptable subject to the following conditions: Confirmation is obtained from the broker that there is no repayment schedule in place for the loan.

## Debt Management Plan (Dmp)

## Epc Rating

The Society requires properties to have a minimum EPC rating of E, or a suitable exemption on application. Properties must also have a minimum potential C rating detailed on the certificate.

## External Cladding

The following rules apply for applications on properties that require an EWS1 form: Properties certified as A1 (there are no attachments whose construction included significant quantities of combustible materials); Properties certified as A2 (there is an appropriate risk of the attachment confirming that no remedial works are required) are considered subject to approval; and Properties certified as B1 (a fire risk assessment completed by a Chartered Engineer or Member of the Institute of Fire Engineers, is sufficiently low that no material works are required), will be considered subject to approval. Properties certified as A3 or B2 as identified on the EWS1 form, are not acceptable.

## Family Lets

Transactions where the property is to be let to a family member are not accepted.

## First Time Landlords

Applications from first time landlords will be considered.

## Further Advances

Further advances for existing customers will only be considered where they have held the mortgage with the Society for at least six months and are up to date with their mortgage payments.

## Home Improvements

Applications for home improvements are available up to 80% LTV.

## House In Multiple Occupation (Hmo)

Applications for HMOs will not be considered

## Interest Cover Ratio (Icr)

The minimum ICR stress rates are detailed in the table below:
| Product rate | Basic Rate Taxpayer | Higher Rate Taxpayer | Limited Co BTL | Ex-Pat BTL |
| ------------ | ------------------- | -------------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| </=3.50%     | 125% @ 5.50%        | 140% @ 5.50%         | 125% @ 5.50%   | 125% @ 5.50% |
| >3.50%       | 125% @ product rate + 2% | 140% @ product rate + 2% | 125% @ product rate + 2% | 125% @ product rate + 2% |
Or payrate if fixed for 5 years or longer.
For Ex-Pat BTL, the basic rate taxpayer ICR calculation will be used for expat applications unless an applicant has UK based income that places them into the higher rate tax band, resulting in the higher rate tax calculation being used.
In circumstances where fees are being added to the loan, the ICR calculation must be calculated on the gross loan amount (including all fees).
The rental income detailed on the valuation report will be used to support the ICR assessment.
The total rental coverage for any background Buy to Lets owed must exceed 140% (or 125% for Limited Companies). This can be calculated across the investment portfolio on an interest only basis.

## Inter-Family Transaction

Transactions where a family member is the vendor are acceptable providing that it is a clear and transparent sale, and that all appropriate taxes (i.e., stamp duty) are paid at completion. In these circumstances the Society will require separate legal representation for the applicant and vendor.

## Japanese Knotweed

Extreme caution will be exercised in the presence of Japanese knotweed or other invasive species.

## Licensing & Selective Licensing

If the property is subject to licensing issues, there may be an adverse effect on potential rental income and future saleability of the property. If the property is in a Selective Licencing area and the licensing is in respect of the property owner, the Society will rely on valuers’ comments, but applications will be considered. Where our valuer confirms that the property is in a Selective Licencing Scheme due to being in a lower income area the application will be declined.

## Limited Company

Applications will be accepted from Limited Companies on the following basis: The company must be a limited company set up solely to own/buy/sell/let property and must have one or more of the following SIC codes (Standard Industrial Classification) 68100: Buying and selling of own real estate; 68209: Other letting and operating of own or leased real estate; or 68320: Management of real estate on a fee or contract basis.
