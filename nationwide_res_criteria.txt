# Calculators

## Affordability calculator

For a thorough assessment of what your client(s) may be able to borrow, use our affordability calculator. We recommend this is always completed before moving to a Decision in Principle (DIP).
Affordability calculator

## House price calculator

Use the House Price calculator on nationwide.co.uk to find out how much a property could be worth and how its value has changed over time. If you don't know the postcode, Royal Mail’s postcode finder (opens in a new window) can help.

## Overpayment calculator

Use the Overpayments calculator on nationwide.co.uk to see how making overpayments could help reduce your client’s mortgage term and interest they’ll pay.

# Affordability calculator

Information:
Remortgage or Additional Borrowing with Debt Consolidation
The calculator may not return an accurate result if your client has multiple credit cards and they’re not all cleared monthly. We recommend that you complete a Decision in Principle (DIP) in NFI Online: https://www.nfionline.co.uk/Login.aspx
Additional borrowing (further advance)
If your client has multiple accounts on different terms, the calculator will not return an accurate result and therefore shouldn't be used. We recommend that you complete a DIP in NFI Online: https://www.nfionline.co.uk/Login.aspx
Like for like remortgage
When applying for a remortgage on a like for like basis , the calculator will return the affordable amount, subject to a maximum of the amount transferred from the existing lender plus £1,000.
For a thorough calculation of how much your client may be able to borrow, fill in the full affordability calculator: https://www.nationwide-intermediary.co.uk/calculators/affordability-calculator
Alternatively, for straightforward cases you can get a quick indication of how much Nationwide could lend by using the quick quote calculator (opens in a new window) on nationwide.co.uk.
To give your client(s) an estimate of how much their property is worth today, use the house price calculator (opens in a new window)
Both calculators are for illustrative purposes and we recommend you complete the full affordability calculator before moving to a Decision in Principle (DIP). The quick quote calculator isn't recommended for self-employed applicants or non-standard transactions.

# Affordability

## In this section we cover:

- Extra help with affordability
- Next steps
- Stress testing
- Top tips on affordability

Maximum borrowing is based on individual affordability. The actual income multiple will vary depending on the application. We take a range of factors into account to determine how much your client can borrow and the minimum affordable term. We aim to ensure your client has enough income remaining after mortgage repayments to cover their outgoings.

### Extra help with affordability

Depending on your client's circumstances, we may be able to lend more when you choose a 5-10 year fixed rate mortgage.

- Minimum income of £40k for a sole applicant or £70k for joint applicants
- Employed or self employed
- House Purchase (Home Movers) and Remortgage clients
- Applications for second properties:
  - if an existing property remains in the background and
  - the new property will be the main residence.

Meeting the criteria doesn't mean we'll always be able to offer extra help. We will not accept:

- Applications in conjunction with any Scheme or Non Standard Ownership type (such as Shared Ownership or Right to Buy)
- Interest only
- Porting
- All other applications for second properties, including:
  - holiday homes
  - dependent relative
  - work related

We also offer a **Helping Hand** exclusively for first time buyers. See: https://www.nationwide-intermediary.co.uk/products/helping-hand

### Next steps

1. **Check the affordability calculator**
   If the affordability calculator result for your client says we might be able to lend more with a 5 or 10 year fixed rate, log in to NFI Online to complete a Decision in Principle (DIP).
   Affordability calculator: https://www.nationwide-intermediary.co.uk/calculators/affordability-calculator

2. **Complete a Decision in Principle (DIP)**
   In the DIP, choose a Fixed Rate (5 years or more) on the 'Product Type' question in Loan Requirements.
   NFI Online (login): https://www.nfionline.co.uk/Login.aspx

3. **Unaffordable?**
   If you key a DIP on a standard lending basis but this is unaffordable, you'll have the option to resubmit on a 5 or 10 year fixed rate.

### Stress testing

As part of the Decision in Principle we'll conduct a stress test on all applications. This is part of our affordability assessment.

It may be possible for our affordability decision to change between DIP and Reserve Product if your client does not meet our affordability criteria after the additional stress testing has been applied.

### Top tips on affordability

- Ask your client to provide their income proofs up front. Before you submit their application, ensure they match the income they've declared.
- Check for any further expenditure or outgoings.
- Does your client have unsecured debts that will take more than six months to pay off? This could impact their application. See Outgoings and unsecured debts: https://www.nationwide-intermediary.co.uk/lending-criteria/outgoings#unsecured-debts
- Make sure you enter your client's outgoings accurately at every stage of keying.
- If the application is unaffordable and you choose to proceed in order to appeal, the decision will be a decline.
- If a joint application is declined, you cannot re-apply with the same clients individually. We may only accept subsequent applications from either of the individuals if there is no longer any connection between them.

# A Helping Hand for first time buyers

Affordability is an issue for many first time buyers. Helping Hand could help first time buyers borrow up to six times their income.

We've made enhancements to the DIP process to show additional affordability when your clients are eligible for Helping Hand. For details, see the 'Next steps' section below.

## Features and benefits

- With Helping Hand, your first time buyers could **borrow up to six times their income.** That's up to 33% more.
- It's available up to 95% LTV, across our 5 and 10 year fixed rated mortgages.
- Your clients could enjoy £500 cashback on completion and up to £500 more for energy efficient homes. Please visit our Green Reward page for more information.

## Eligibility

The availability of Helping Hand is subject to many factors, for example credit score and how much debt the applicant has. Below you'll find the eligibility criteria for your clients.

- All applicants must be first time buyers
- 5 and 10 year fixed rates available at all LTV tiers up to 95%
- Minimum income of £30,000 sole applicant or £50,000 for joint applicants. You can include all income sources (except self-employed income)

The maximum lending limits depend on the application. See our LTV and maximum loan size criteria.

If your client is not a first time buyer, they may be eligible for Extra help with affordability.

**Meeting the criteria doesn't guarantee we'll offer your clients Helping Hand.**

### We won't accept:

- Self-employed income for either applicant
- In conjunction with any scheme or non-standard ownership type. For example First Homes, Shared Ownership, Genuine Bargain Price, Right to Buy and Help to Buy.
- Interest Only.

Note: Where your client has the offer of Helping Hand, it will only be available to first time buyers on the original purchase. It won't be available on any subsequent transactions, such as additional borrowing where standard criteria applies.

## How Helping Hand could work for your clients

For applicants who are eligible first time buyers with a 5% deposit and no other costs affecting how much they can afford, Helping Hand may allow them to borrow:

- Up to £300,000 for joint applicants with a joint income of £50,000. This is an **additional £75,000 compared to £225,000 without Helping Hand**.
- Up to £180,000 for a single applicant with an income of £30,000. This is an **additional £45,000 compared to £135,000 without Helping Hand**.
- Up to £540,000 for joint applicants with an income of £90,000. This is an **additional £135,000 compared to £405,000 without Helping Hand**. With average London house prices at £528,000, Helping Hand could help your clients purchase a home where house prices are higher than average.

## Next steps

1. **Use the affordability calculator** to find out if your client requires the higher borrowing offered by Helping Hand. For all eligible first time buyers, the Affordability calculator will indicate two maximum affordable amounts, one for standard and one for Helping Hand.

2. **In the DIP decision screen**, if your clients are eligible, it may return standard affordability and Helping Hand. By selecting Helping Hand, only products of 5 years or more will be displayed at full application. We're unable to provide further details if your client isn't offered Helping Hand. This may be down to a number of different factors.

## Amending a Full Mortgage Application to Helping Hand

If you've submitted a Full Mortgage Application which has failed affordability, and you want to amend it to Helping Hand to increase the affordability, you'll need to state that the application requires 'Helping Hand'. You'll also need to change the product to a Fixed Rate of 5 years or more.

You can do this by either:

- using the 'Amend case' option (see our Amend Case page for more information)
- or by contacting us to make a change to your application.

# Essential criteria

## In this section we cover:

- Number of applicants
- Mortgage term
- Maximum loan amount
- Minimum loan amount
- Age
- Area
- Credit scoring
- Types of borrower
- Offers
- Sources of deposit
- Unacceptable deposit sources
- Product criteria

### Number of applicants

### Mortgage term

Maximum term up to 40 years.

### Maximum loan amount

Maximum loan amount: £750,000 to £5 million, depending on product type and other restrictions.

£25,000 for new customers moving home or remortgaging.

### Age

Minimum 18, maximum 75 for new borrowers.

Maximum retirement age: 70.

See below for information on retired borrowers.

We will continue to lend to existing borrowers over 75 in certain circumstances.

Existing Nationwide borrowers under age 75: If your client's current Nationwide mortgage term extends beyond their 75th birthday, they can take out a new mortgage over the term remaining on their current loan. This is subject to satisfying all other lending criteria.

They may also apply to port their existing product over the term remaining on their current loan, as long as:
- Any additional borrowing must be on new products
- Any additional borrowing must be repaid on or before their 75th birthday
- They continue to meet our standard status requirements and comply with our lending criteria
- They pay any applicable ERCs if they reduce the loan amount
- They do not increase the term beyond the current remaining term

Existing Nationwide borrowers age 75 and over: Your client may apply to port their product over the term remaining on their current loan, as long as they:
- Continue to meet our standard status requirements and comply with our lending criteria
- Pay any applicable Early Repayment Charges (ERCs) if they reduce the loan
- Do not increase the term beyond the current remaining term
- Do not increase the loan to value (LTV)
- Do not take any additional borrowing

### Area

We'll lend on properties in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

We'll consider applications for properties on specific Scottish islands.

Scottish islands we may lend on: Arran, Barra, Benbecula, Bute, Coll, Harris, Islay, Jura, Lewis, Mull, North Uist, The Orkneys, The Shetlands, Skye, South Uist, Tire.

Scottish and other islands we won't lend on: Any Scottish islands not included in the above list; Channel Islands; Isle of Man; Isles of Scilly; Republic of Ireland.

### Credit scoring

All applicants are credit scored before a mortgage is offered, usually at Decision in Principle (DIP) stage. The DIP will leave a soft footprint against the applicant's credit record. A hard footprint will be left when you submit the full application.

We may obtain information from up to 3 bureaus; Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. Multiple credit searches over a short period may affect your client's credit rating. You should explain this to your client before submitting their application.

The credit reference must cover all addresses for all applicants in the last 3 years. We can't accept applicants who can't provide an acceptable full 3 year UK address history.

### Types of borrower

#### Armed Forces

We accept income from British Armed Forces personnel. We'll also accept applications from personnel purchasing a property to let straight away. They will need to occupy the property within three years.

We'll also accept additional borrowing (further advance) applications. However, where the property is already let, this will only be for essential or green improvements.

Where your client can't provide UK address history, you can key the Ministry of Defence BFPO postcode that corresponds to their barracks.

We support the Forces Help to Buy (FHTB) scheme. You can find more information on FHTB on our housing schemes page.

#### Gurkhas

For Gurkhas who have completed four or more years' service in the British Armed Forces, you can key as having Indefinite Leave to Remain. You will need to provide proof of length of service.

For Gurkhas who don't have this length of service or Indefinite Leave to Remain, you should key as Non-EEA foreign nationals. However, Tier 1 or 2 visa proof isn't required.

#### Expats and applicants working abroad

All applicants must be resident in the UK for tax purposes when the mortgage completes. You'll also need to include additional outgoings abroad if your applicant works abroad.

We'll consider applications where:
- your client is a UK national working abroad and their family (such as spouse and children) will remain in the UK as occupiers. It's expected that the spouse will be a joint borrower.
- your clients can provide a full UK address history for the last 3 years.
- your client has self-employed income from outside the UK.

However, we won't accept where:
- the property is to be let or left unoccupied while your client works abroad.
- your client's income is paid in a foreign currency.
- your client has self-employed income from outside the UK.

#### First time buyers

We can offer higher LTVs and a Helping Hand for first time buyers. See: https://www.nationwide-intermediary.co.uk/products/helping-hand

#### Foreign nationals

Standard lending criteria apply to foreign nationals with:
- Republic of Ireland (ROI) citizenship
- Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR)
- EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) Settled or Pre-Settled status

All other foreign nationals:
- Minimum income: primary basic income of £50,000 for single applicants, £75,000 joint. We will only apply this criteria if income from the applicant without ILR is needed for affordability. Minimum income determines if applicants are eligible for a higher LTV.
- Maximum LTV: 85% if minimum income criteria are met. 75% if minimum income criteria are not met.
- Proofs of right to live and work in the UK
- Proof of residency and full UK address history for the last 3 years.
- At least 12 months remaining on their visa when you upload the proof. This also applies if they have a points-based visa or the joint borrower is a UK national. Where you're not using income for an applicant without 'Indefinite Leave to Remain', we don't require 12 months remaining on the visa, however the visa must still be valid.
- Their salary must be paid into a UK bank account. Note that for these purposes, the Channel Islands are not considered part of the UK.
- Their primary basic income must be paid in GBP £ sterling.

Note: we no longer accept the Biometric Residence Permit or Biometric Residence cards. The gov.uk check someone's immigration status tool is the best proof for the majority of cases.

#### Joint borrower-sole proprietor applications

We don't currently support joint borrower/sole proprietor applications.

#### Retired borrowers

If the mortgage term extends into your client's retirement, the following criteria apply.

Key facts:
- The maximum retirement age we can accept is 70.
- The mortgage term must end before the oldest applicant's 75th birthday.
- We won't accept foreign currency income.

Retirement is 10 years or more away: We will use current income for affordability purposes. You must provide proof of a current and/or past pension other than State Pension. For example, a payslip showing a pension deduction, pension statement or pension payment on a bank statement.

Retirement is less than 10 years away: You'll need to provide details of your client's current income and expected retirement income. For affordability purposes, we'll use the lower of the two. We'll need the following information, usually from the latest annual pension illustration, annual statement of pension, or letter from the pension provider confirming pension due on retirement:
- The retirement age on the proof should match or be dated before your client's declared retirement age.
- The proof must show their projected retirement income. Confirmation of current/future fund value only is not acceptable.
- If the proof assumes your client will not take the tax-free cash on retirement, we'll use 75% of the annual pension income figure quoted. You'll need to calculate and key this manually.
- If the proof includes the 25% Pension Commencement Lump Sum (PCLS), you can key the full income.
- If the proof quotes 'Low', 'Medium' and 'High' growth rates, we will assess income assuming the 'Medium' growth rate.
- We can consider pension plans offering flexible drawdown options, such as Self Invested Personal Pensions (SIPPs) as part of expected retirement income.

For joint applications where the second applicant is not contributing towards affordability because they are a student, homemaker, or unemployed, proof of their pension isn't needed.

### Income in a foreign currency

Income paid in a foreign currency isn’t acceptable for the following new lending applications:
- Purchases (including second property types)
- Remortgages
- Further advances
- Porting with additional borrowing
You can't use foreign currency income if your client is looking to complete a combination of transactions, such as a term change and additional borrowing.
Applications using foreign currency income without new lending
- We won't consider foreign currency income for existing Nationwide customers moving home, where they don't require any new lending. This includes clients porting without additional borrowing.
- We'll consider foreign currency income for existing Nationwide customers looking to change their term or repayment type.
- We won't need to consider foreign currency income if there's no affordability assessment required, such as switching rates at deal end, we won't need to look at income.

### Credit Scoring

All applicants are credit scored before a mortgage is offered. This is usually at Decision in Principle stage. Obtaining a Decision in Principle will record a soft footprint against the applicant's credit record(s). It is when the full application is submitted that a hard footprint is left.
If you're told the application is unaffordable, and you do choose to proceed, the decision will result in a decline. You should only use this if you intend on appealing the decision later on.
Acceptable credit score for your client:
- The credit reference must cover all addresses for all parties in the last 3 years. We can't accept applicants who can't provide an acceptable full 3 year UK address history.
- The applicant must not be an undischarged bankrupt.
- We'll consider applicants discharged for at least 3 years.
When completing a credit assessment on your client we may obtain information from up to 3 bureaus; Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. When you submit a full application, we're required to leave a footprint highlighting that we've performed a search connected with mortgage lending. This will leave a hard footprint at each agency we use. Multiple credit searches over a short period may affect your client's credit rating. You should explain this to your client before submitting their application.
Any joint applications which results in a decline must not then be scored individually to try for an accept decision. Even if either applicant in their own right has sufficient income to support the mortgage. We may only accept subsequent applications from either of the individuals if there is no longer any connection between the original applicants.

### Inherited properties

We would expect to see an application for an inherited property as a remortgage transaction. However, it'll be down to the conveyancer to advise how to structure the transaction.
Please note: if an applicant is porting their current Nationwide mortgage product to an inherited property, you will need to key this as a purchase application. This is because product porting is not available on remortgage applications.
You don't need to key where there is an existing mortgage on the property which isn't connected to the applicant(s). Any mortgages that are in the applicant(s) names should be keyed to the case in the usual way.
Where you're structuring the transaction as a purchase, you should key the deposit relating to the inherited element as ‘Equity’.
If applicants are purchasing from a deceased persons' estate, and they're not beneficiaries, you should key as a purchase application.
The table below provides remortgage keying guidance for the most common scenarios:
Applicant is the sole beneficiary of a mortgage free property: Remortgage
Applicant is the sole beneficiary of a mortgaged property: Other Personal Consumption
Applicant is not the sole beneficiary on a mortgage free property: N/A
Applicant is not the sole beneficiary on a mortgaged property: Other Personal Consumption

### Unsecured debt

Outgoings criteria (incl. unsecured debts): https://www.nationwide-intermediary.co.uk/lending-criteria/outgoings#unsecured-debts

Clients intending to pay off unsecured debt, that has more than six months to run, may be asked to provide proof that the debt has been paid off in full. This is before we can proceed to offer.
Examples of acceptable proofs we may require include:
- A credit card statement showing that the balance has been cleared
- A document from a loan company confirming the loan has been paid off
Where you're clearing more than one unsecured debt, we’ll need proof of repayment for each sole debt. Screenshots are acceptable.
We may accept if the unsecured debt is being repaid with equity from the sale of the client’s main residence.
Contact one of our experienced advisers using Broker Chat if you need more information.

### Offers (and how long they're valid for)

- Rate Switch offers are valid until the end of the day they're produced

Non New Build Offer Extensions
Where your client is purchasing or remortgaging a property and the offer is due to expire, you may be able to request an offer extension of 45 days. This is subject to eligibility and criteria. You'll need confirmation that your clients' circumstances haven’t materially changed. The following is a list of acceptable reasons for an extension request:
- Nationwide, or a conveyancer acting under the Free Legal Fee Service, has made an error. Or caused the delay and completion is imminent.
- Where the funds have been released before but were returned as completion did not take place and the money is now required urgently.
- Delay caused by the death of someone in the chain e.g. vendor.
- Delay caused due to outstanding legal, title &/or property matters. This is subject to review by our Property team.
- Delay caused by delayed completion of a new build property in the chain.
- Delay caused by vendor’s sale falling through.
In order to request the extension for one of the above reasons, email mortgageofferextensions@nationwide.co.uk. You'll need to confirm the following information:
- Case Number
- Reason for Extension
- Whether they have exchanged contracts or missives concluded (Scotland)
- Have any material changes to income and/or outgoings been declared and detail the changes.
The 45 days extension is inclusive of the 15-day grace period applied to all offers.
Your client will receive an automated text message to confirm the offer is due to expire, even though it may have been extended. This is nothing to worry about as the email you receive confirming the offer extension supersedes this. You may want to make your client aware to ignore this text message where an extension has been applied for and granted.
You should only contact us if the original offer is within 30 days of expiry. To help us process your request, please submit no later than 15 days before the offer is due to expire.

### Armed forces

We accept income from British Armed Forces personnel. We'll also accept applications from personnel purchasing a property to let straight away. As long as they intend to occupy the property within three years.

We support the Forces Help to Buy (FHTB) scheme. You can find more information about FHTB on our housing schemes page.
Gurkhas
For Gurkhas who have completed four or more years service in the British Armed Forces, you can key as having indefinite leave to remain. You will need to provide Proof of length of service. For Gurkhas who don’t have indefinite leave to remain, you should key as Non-EEA foreign nationals. However, Tier 1 or 2 visa proof isn't required as they're serving in the British Armed Forces.

### Ex-pats and applicants working abroad

All applicants must be resident in the UK for tax purposes when the mortgage has completed.
We'll consider applications where :
- your client's a UK national working abroad and their family (ie spouse and children) will remain in the UK as occupiers. It's expected that the spouse will be a joint borrower.
- if your clients can provide a full UK address history for the last 3 years. And they can satisfy our current ID policy, proof of residency requirements and underwriting criteria.
However, we won't accept where :
- the property is to be let or left unoccupied whilst your client works abroad.

**Validating proofs**
We won't request to see any proofs if we can seek to validate your client's income using credit bureau information.

**Interest Only**
The minimum income criteria is £75,000 for sole applicants or £100,000 for joint applicants, based on basic income only. The minimum income criteria will determine if your clients are eligible for our interest only product. We'll make an assessment using their primary basic source of income. You can't use Secondary income, bonus, overtime or commission.

**Work Report**
To reduce the number of proofs we need, we use a tool called 'Work Report from Experian'. This tool can automate income verification and provides us with digital payroll data. This can remove the need to upload payslips proofs on cases where it finds a match.
Please don't attach proofs to an application if they aren't requested. This may delay the progress of your case.

**How it works:**
- NFI Online includes a screen in the ‘Employment and Income section’
- You’ll need to provide your applicant(s) employer and National Insurance number
- If the company is registered to the service, and the data matches, this will remove the need to upload the payslip.
We use Work Report to check for:
- Employed income
- Basic salary (this will not include any bonus, overtime or commission income)
- Primary employer income (you can't use this for more than one employer).
For further information on Work Report and how we use your client’s information, you can visit our Nationwide customer website (opens in a new window).

This must appear on all payslips in the last 3 months.

You can't use it if the header includes the words Reserve, Reserve Band or Reserve Banding.

If the daily rate is the same across all 3 months, you can use it as basic pay (average of the last 3 payslip amounts). If the daily rate is not the same, you can only use it as overtime.

The daily rate is the payslip amount divided by the number of days in the payslip month.

**Non-Armed Forces Recruit and Retain (RRP)**

This must appear on all payslips in the last 3 months or 8 weeks. You must provide supporting evidence (employer letter or contract) to confirm the payment is ongoing and is permanent/guaranteed.

If the amount paid across all payslips is the same, you can use it as basic pay. If the payment varies, you can only use it as overtime.

**Market Supplement**

We'll consider market supplements if the employer confirms this is a permanent payment. We'll require confirmation for all cases.

If the amount paid across the last eight weeks or three months payslips is the same, you can use it as basic pay. If the payment varies, you can only use it as overtime.

### Income from bonus, overtime and commission (BOC)

- For all applications where we require BOC, we'll apply the average amount of any frequency.
- For any BOC to be acceptable it must be present on the latest payslip.
- BOC is acceptable for Fixed Term Contractors.
- Tronc is a common term for tips and service charge payments in restaurants and hotels - we treat this as Commission. For employees using TipJar, we'll accept the applicants ‘Your Tip Share’ statement. They can provide this by printing it from the online portal or a payment breakdown statement. If shown on the statement, we'll use the 'Tips before tax' figure for affordability purposes.
- For employees using TipJar, we'll accept the applicants ‘Your Tip Share’ statement. They can provide this by printing it from the online portal or a payment breakdown statement. If shown on the statement, we'll use the 'Tips before tax' figure for affordability purposes.
- Provided the latest payslip shows BOC, we will treat any remaining payslips not showing BOC as £0 in the averaging. We can't use the latest payslip if it doesn't show a payment. Please note: For annual bonus and commission, both proofs must show a payment. For half yearly bonus and commission, at least 2 of the 4 proofs (including the most recent one) must show a payment.
- For annual bonus and commission, both proofs must show a payment.
- For half yearly bonus and commission, at least 2 of the 4 proofs (including the most recent one) must show a payment.
- If BOC is not present on the latest payslip, then you must provide a subsequent payslip that shows BOC once available.  We'll then calculate BOC using the most recent payslip. For Weekly/Fortnightly paid applicants only – where no BOC is on the latest payslip, but the payslip shows holiday/sick pay, you don't need to obtain a subsequent payslip.
- For Weekly/Fortnightly paid applicants only – where no BOC is on the latest payslip, but the payslip shows holiday/sick pay, you don't need to obtain a subsequent payslip.
- If you're using a combination of BOC (e.g. bonus and overtime), each type of BOC must be on the provided proofs. It's important to ensure you enter the income into the correct income type and with the correct frequency. For income not labelled bonus, overtime and commission see here.

Below you'll find what to use when keying your application within NFI Online. The proofs to evidence this are:
Bonus / Overtime / Commission (BOC): Monthly / 4 weekly
Fortnightly: Add the total BOC from the last 6 fortnightly payslips, and then divide this by 12. Key this as weekly. Please note: Where no BOC is present on the latest payslip, but the payslip shows holiday/sick pay, you do not need to obtain a subsequent payslip.
Weekly: The average amount from the latest 8 payslips Please note: Where no BOC is present on the latest payslips, but the payslip shows holiday/sick pay, you don't need to obtain a subsequent payslip.
Bonus / Commission: Quarterly
Half yearly: The average amount from the latest 4 payslips
Annual: The average amount from the latest 2 payslips
Add the total BOC from the last 6 fortnightly payslips, and then divide this by 12. Key this as weekly.
Please note: Where no BOC is present on the latest payslip, but the payslip shows holiday/sick pay, you do not need to obtain a subsequent payslip.
The average amount from the latest 8 payslips
Please note: Where no BOC is present on the latest payslips, but the payslip shows holiday/sick pay, you don't need to obtain a subsequent payslip.

### Additional income - not labelled bonus, overtime and commission

Acceptable income: Proofs required
: Weekly / Fortnightly / Monthly / Four Weekly
Additional income is same amount across all payslips*: Treat as basic
Additional income is variable across all payslips*: Treat as overtime
Additional income is the same or variable but not on all payslips*: This income can't be used as it does not appear on all payslips.
*To calculate any basic, bonus, overtime, commission or additional income we must be in receipt of the correct number of payslips as per the income from employment table above.

### Temporary Workers and Zero Hours Contractors

We treat Temporary Workers and Zero Hours Contractors (ZHC) the same, so you should key both as ‘Employed Temporary’.
A ZHC contract is where an employer and employee have entered into an open ended contract with no guaranteed minimum working hours.
Example of roles where ZHC contracts may apply, but aren't limited to, include:
- Bank Nurses (NHS & Non-NHS), Supply Teachers and Locums etc
- Piecework or Pricework are types of employment in which the employee is paid at a fixed rate per unit produced or action performed.
- Income from Retained/on-call Firefighters and Armed Forces Reservists.
Temporary employees have contracts which are limited to a certain period of time. The arrangement may be via an Agency or directly through an employer. We draw no distinction between temporary Agency workers or those employed directly.
Applicants who are Temporary Workers or ZHC must have been employed on this basis for at least 12 months with the same employer. The only exception being the following:
- NHS bank nurses
- NHS Locums
- Supply Teachers
- We still require a 12 month history. This doesn't have to be with the same NHS trust/the same school provided they worked a complete year within the same occupation.
- We still require a 12 month history. This doesn't have to be with the same NHS trust/the same school provided they worked a complete year within the same occupation.
The following continues to apply:
- Income from the above is only acceptable where it's not the primary income i.e. there must be another employed/self-employed/pension income, which is higher, it doesn’t have to be a second job.
- The latest P60 and most recent payslip are required to calculate the income.
- The income should be the lower of the latest P60 total or the most recent payslip year to date annualised.

#### Piecework/Pricework

Where the employee receives pay at a fixed rate per unit produced or action performed. We'll assess this using the Temporary worker/ZHC income criteria above.
If your client's employment contract is subject to a minimum number of guaranteed hours or the contract confirms their income won't fall below the National Minimum Wage, they can choose to follow the ZHC/temporary worker approach, or:
- Treat the guaranteed element as basic income.
- Treat as overtime anything over and above the guaranteed element.
- Key the applicant as permanent or employed (won't need to use the criteria for ZHC/temporary workers).
You must provide a copy of the applicant’s employment contract, along with the latest 3 month payslips. This is to verify any overtime element.
If you're using basic income with overtime, we'll waive the 12 month minimum time with employer requirement. For this you must submit:
- A copy of the applicant’s employment contract
- And the latest 3 month payslips to verify the overtime element.

### Affordability

Maximum borrowing is based on individual affordability. The actual income multiple will vary depending on the application. We take a range of factors into account to determine how much can be borrowed and the minimum affordable term. Our calculation aims to ensure individuals have a sufficient proportion of their income remaining. This is after their mortgage repayments to cover their outgoings.

### Top tips on affordability

- Ask your client to provide their income proofs up front. Before you submit their application, ensure they match the income they've declared.
- Check for any further expenditure or outgoings. For example payslips; bank statements; credit reports (if available from your client).
- Check if your client has any unsecured debt , which has more than six months to run. This could impact their application.
- Once you have the full picture on your client's outgoings, make sure they're entered accurately and in full in the appropriate field. This applies when keying their affordability/DIP/application.

### Extra help with affordability

Depending on your client’s circumstances, we may be able to lend more when you choose a 5-10 year fixed rate mortgage.
- House Purchase (Home Movers) clients
- Employed or self employed
- Minimum income of £40k for a sole applicant or £70k for joint applicants.
Meeting the criteria doesn’t mean we’ll always be able to offer extra help
We won’t accept:
- Applications in conjunction with any Scheme or Non-Standard Ownership type (such as Shared Ownership or Right to Buy)
- Interest only
- Porting
- Applications for second properties. This includes holiday homes, dependent relative or for work reasons. Extra help will only be available if:
- an existing property remains in the background and
- the new property will be the main residence.
- an existing property remains in the background and
- the new property will be the main residence.
Next steps
- If the affordability calculator result for your client says we might be able to lend more with a 5 or 10 year fixed rate, log in to NFI Online to complete a Decision in Principle (DIP)
- In the DIP, choose a Fixed Rate (5 years or more) on the ‘Product Type’ question in Loan Requirements.
- If you key a DIP on a standard lending basis but this is unaffordable, you’ll have the option to resubmit on a 5 or 10 year fixed rate.

### Affordability calculator

Our affordability calculator will allow you to check how much we might lend your client. This is without having to undertake a full Decision in Principle which will involve credit scoring your client.

#### Saving your affordability calculator results

To save your clients results, follow the steps below:
1. Fill in the calculator as normal.
2. On the results page press ‘Print’.
3. You should then see a Print Options screen that asks you to ‘select printer’. Scroll until you find any of the following options:
- Adobe PDF
- Microsoft XPS Document Writer
- PDF Creator - you can download a free version of PDF Creator here (opens in a new window)
4. Select one of the options above, then press ‘print’.
5. After a few moments, a window should pop up asking you to ‘Save File As’. Choose your destination folder as normal and press ‘save’. You have now saved your client’s results.

### Stress testing

As part of the Decision in Principle we'll conduct a stress test on all applications. This is part of our affordability assessment.
We may be required to do a stress test at a higher rate when your client is porting an old product to their new property. This is due the interest rate of your client's existing product.
Once you've decided that you want to port the relevant account, we'll do this extra stress test (where necessary) within NFI Online.
It may be possible for our affordability decision to change between DIP and Reserve Product if your client does not meet our affordability criteria after the additional stress testing has been applied.

### Like for like

If your client(s) is an existing Nationwide mortgage customer moving home, we'll consider their application on a ‘Like for Like’ basis where:
- The total amount of the borrowing (excluding product fees if added), is no more than the existing borrowing
- There is no change of applicant(s) (i.e. not adding, removing or replacing an applicant)
- The borrower is not changing their current repayment method
- The term of the new mortgage is not shorter than the current term.
- We'll allow term extensions unless the borrower(s) is already retired OR the term extension takes the borrower(s) into retirement OR further into retirement.
- already retired OR
- the term extension takes the borrower(s) into retirement OR
- further into retirement.
- already retired OR
- the term extension takes the borrower(s) into retirement OR
- further into retirement.
On Like for Like applications we'll require you to provide all generated proofs. This includes Proof of Income.
If your client(s) mortgage is on Interest only and meets the above criteria (but fails affordability assessment), you must manually appeal these cases. You can do this through your BDM. They will then send your appeal to our underwriting team to review.
We'll require 3 months bank statements. This is in addition to the documents automatically requested when you submit an application.

### Lending into retirement

The maximum retirement age is 70. The mortgage term must not extend beyond the 75th birthday of the eldest applicant.
Where the mortgage term extends into retirement, the following criteria apply.
Retirement is less than 10 years away
- Provide details of both current income and expected retirement income.
- For affordability purposes, use the lower of the current income or expected retirement income.
- We won't accept foreign currency income.
- Private/Occupational Pension Schemes:
- You must prove the latest annual pension illustration. The retirement age on the illustration should match (or be dated prior to) the applicant’s declared retirement age.
- Where the illustration assumes the tax-free cash won't be taken on retirement, we'll use 75% of the annual pension income figure quoted. This needs to be calculated and keyed manually.
- Where the illustration already caters for the 25% PCLS, the full income can be keyed/used.
- If the pension illustration quotes ‘Low’, ‘Medium’ and ‘High’ growth rates, income will be assessed assuming the ‘Medium’ growth rate.
- For applicants who have not yet retired (but the mortgage term takes them into retirement) pension plans offering flexible drawdown options (such as SIPPs) can be considered towards the expected retirement income.
- The applicant must provide an annual pension statement showing their projected retirement income (confirmation of current/future fund value only is not acceptable).
- Where the illustration assumes the tax-free cash won't be taken on retirement, we'll use 75% of the annual pension income figure quoted. This needs to be calculated and keyed manually.
- Where the illustration already caters for the 25% PCLS, the full income can be keyed/used.
- For applicants who have not yet retired (but the mortgage term takes them into retirement) pension plans offering flexible drawdown options (such as SIPPs) can be considered towards the expected retirement income.
- The applicant must provide an annual pension statement showing their projected retirement income (confirmation of current/future fund value only is not acceptable).
- For joint applications where one applicant is working and the other is a homemaker, student or unemployed (and not contributing towards affordability), and the term takes the applicant who is a homemaker, student or unemployed into retirement, then a proof of a pension isn't required.
Retirement is 10 years or more away
- Current income used for affordability purposes.
- Evidence of the existence of a current and/or past pension (other than State Pension). For example a payslip showing a pension deduction, pension statement or pension payment on a bank statement.
- We won't accept foreign currency income.

### Clients with additional properties

Where your client has, or will have on completion, only one mortgaged property, standard LTV limits will apply. Maximum 85% LTV will continue to apply if the client will own two or more mortgaged properties on completion. We'll treat this as a Second Property application. This applies even if you're purchasing or remortgaging the property to be your client’s main residence. For this purpose, we don't count background properties owned in an applicants Limited Company or Limited Liability Partnership.
If your client owns more than one property, we'll require all addresses and mortgage details. Please see our products, loan size and maximum LTV criteria.
We'll consider the outstanding balance of any mortgages that are continuing. Unless there is a simultaneous The Mortgage Works Let to Buy application submitted for the existing residential. Or they're let and satisfy the following:
- The rent received is less than 160% of the current mortgage payment. We'll include the difference in the affordability calculation.
- We treat let properties as self-financing where the property is let on an AST. And the rent received is at least 160% of the current mortgage payments.
- Evidence of the latest three months’ rental payments using the Applicant’s latest three months' bank statements.^
- Pay the rental by Direct Debit / Standing Order.
- Unless they're owned as part of a property letting business, we'll review each rental property owned by your client one by one. See Rental Income from a Letting Business.
- We can't use rental income from properties let abroad. However, where the mortgage is continuing, you should key the mortgage details into the application. Where the mortgage debt is in a foreign currency, it should be converted to sterling.
There is no requirement to obtain past payment history proof for foreign currency mortgages. Normal requirements apply to mortgages in sterling secured on properties abroad.
^ If your client has an existing Nationwide current account or mortgage, there’s no need for you to provide their statement(s) if it’s generated as a case requirement. Complete this form , then Scan and Attach it to clear the requirement.
If you're completing a Let to Buy application with The Mortgage Works, you can find further guidance in our Let to Buy processing guide.

### Outgoings

We'll need to consider any regular outgoings your client has in addition to their income for affordability. These include:
Credit commitments:: Outstanding credit card balances. This including store cards, mail order and budget accounts. Outstanding mortgage balances. This includes mortgages held abroad. See Clients with Additional Properties for details of when we treat mortgages as self-financing. Monthly payments for personal loans and hire purchases with more than 6 months to run.

If your client has previously had an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA), we may consider the case if this has been discharged for at least 3 years. The application may be subject to a more detailed underwrite.
We won’t normally lend if applicants are three or more months in mortgage arrears, depending on when the arrears occurred. We can consider applications where there are less mortgage arrears, although this may be subject to a more detailed underwrite.
We'll consider lending to applicants that have current or previous defaults depending on:
- the value
- the date registered.
The application may be subject to a more detailed underwrite.

# Employment income

## In this section we cover:

- Income proofs
- Income from employment
- Bonus, overtime and commission income (BOC)
- Other types of employment income
- Temporary employment and zero hours contracts
- Contractors
- Employment status

### Income proofs

#### Work report

To reduce the number of proofs we need, we use a tool called Work Report from Experian.

This tool can automate income verification and provides us with digital payroll data. This can remove the need to upload payslips proofs on cases where it finds a match.

#### How it works:

- NFI Online includes a screen in the 'Employment and Income section'
- You'll need to provide your applicant(s) employer and National Insurance number
- If the company is registered to the service, and the data matches, you will not have to upload the payslip.

#### We use Work Report to check for:

- Employed income
- Basic salary (this will not include any bonus, overtime or commission income)
- Primary employer income (you can't use this for more than one employer)

For further information on Work Report and how we use your client's information, you can visit our Nationwide customer website.

#### Validating proofs

We won't request to see any proofs if we can validate your client's income using credit bureau information. **Please don't attach proofs to an application if they aren't requested**. This may delay the progress of your case.

### Income from employment

#### Provide the latest payslip for:

- Basic pay (**3 months' payslips** for National Rail and supermarket workers)
- Car/shift/location allowance
- Mortgage subsidies
- Pension benefit fund
- Police housing allowance
- Teaching and Learning Responsibility payment (TLR) 1 or 2
- Value account.

For more details, download our guide to payslip requirements (PDF, 46.9KB).

### Bonus, overtime and commission income (BOC)

When you include BOC in your client's application, we average it. The number of payslips you need to average and include as proofs depends on how frequently BOC is paid.

Payslips must be consecutive and from the same employer.

| How often is BOC paid? | Number of payslips to prove BOC                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Weekly                 | 8                                                                   |
| Fortnightly            | 6                                                                   |
| Four weekly            | 3                                                                   |
| Monthly                | 3                                                                   |
| Quarterly              | 3 - the oldest payslip should be no older than 12 months before DIP |
| Half yearly            | 4 - the oldest payslip should be no older than 25 months before DIP |
| Annually               | 2 - the oldest payslip should be no older than 25 months before DIP |

#### Keying BOC

- Add up the BOC shown on each payslip and divide to get the average figure. Don't forget to include any payslips that show £0 in the average.
- For fortnightly pay, divide by 12 and key as weekly.
- If you want to include a combination of BOC, such as both a bonus and overtime, each type of BOC must be on the provided proofs.

#### Special cases

- **If BOC was not paid** on the latest payslip, you must provide the next payslip that shows BOC when it is available. We'll then calculate the BOC average including that payslip.
- **Weekly/Fortnightly paid** applicants who were not paid BOC on the latest payslip, do not need to provide an additional payslip if it shows holiday/sick pay.
- We accept BOC for **Fixed Term Contractors**.
- We will only consider the **cash element** if part of the bonus or commission is paid directly into a pension.
- **Tronc** is a common term for tips and service charge payments in restaurants and hotels. We treat this as Commission. For employees using TipJar, we'll accept the applicant's 'Your Tip Share' statement. They can provide this by printing it from the online portal or a payment breakdown statement. If shown on the statement, we'll use the 'Tips before tax' figure for affordability purposes.

#### Additional income - not labelled bonus, overtime and commission

If there is additional income on your client's payslips that is not clearly labelled as bonus, overtime, or commission, check our unacceptable income list. If it is not on that list, and it is paid on all payslips, it can be used.

#### Is the additional income the same across all payslips?

- If your client is paid weekly/fortnightly/four weekly/monthly: treat as **basic pay**.
- If your client is paid quarterly/half yearly/annually: treat as **overtime**.

#### Is the additional income a variable amount, but appears on all payslips?

- Treat as overtime no matter how often your client is paid.

We need a number of payslips as proof of income treated as bonus, overtime or commission based on how often your client is paid, as listed above.

### Other types of employment income

#### Foreign currency income

**With new lending**

Income paid in a foreign currency is not acceptable for the following new lending applications:

- Purchases (including second property types)
- Remortgages
- Further advances
- Porting with additional borrowing

You cannot use foreign currency income if your client is looking to complete a combination of transactions, such as a term change and additional borrowing.

**Without new lending**

- We'll consider foreign currency income for existing Nationwide customers looking to change their term or repayment type.
- We will not consider foreign currency income for existing Nationwide customers moving home, where they do not require any new lending. This includes clients porting without additional borrowing.
- We will not consider foreign currency income if there's no affordability assessment required, such as switching rates at deal end.

#### Housing allowance

- Police housing allowance is treated as basic pay.
- Non-Police housing allowance requires the latest 3 months' payslips. If paid on a different schedule, provide the equivalent in weekly, fortnightly or 4 week payslips. If the payment varies across the payslips, we'll take the average.

You must also provide an employment contract or letter confirming the payment is contractual, guaranteed and will not end even if the applicant takes on a mortgage.

#### Market Supplement

Provide the **latest 3 months' or 8 weeks' payslips**. If the amount paid on each payslip from the period is the same, you can use it as basic pay. If the payment varies, you can only use it as overtime.

You must also provide an employment contract or letter confirming this is a permanent payment.

#### Recruit and Retain (RRP)

**Armed Forces RRP**

You cannot use this if the header includes the words:

- Reserve
- Reserve Band
- Reserve Banding

Provide the **latest 3 months' payslips**. The payment must appear on all payslips from this period.

- Divide the payslip amount by the number of days in the payslip month for a daily rate.
- If the daily rate is the same across all 3 months, you can use it as basic pay. To do this, take the average of the 3 payslips.
- If the daily rate is not the same, you can only use it as overtime.

**All other RRP**

- Provide the **latest 3 months' or 8 weeks' payslips**. If the amount of RRP on each payslip is the same, you can use it as basic pay. If it varies, you can only use it as overtime.
- This payment must appear on all payslips in the period. You must also provide an employment contract or letter confirming this is a permanent/guaranteed payment.

### Temporary employment and zero hours contracts

Temporary employees have contracts which are limited to a certain period of time. The arrangement may be via an agency or directly through the employer. We treat temporary agency workers and those employed directly the same.

A zero hours contract is an open ended contract with no guaranteed minimum working hours.

Example of roles using these types of contracts include:

- Bank nurses (NHS & private), Locums, Supply teachers
- Retained/on-call Firefighters and Armed Forces Reservists

We treat temporary workers and those on zero hours contracts the same, so key both as 'Employed Temporary'.

#### Applicants must:

- have been employed on this basis for at least 12 months with the same employer.
- NHS bank nurses or locums and supply teachers require a 12 month history, but this does not need to be with the same NHS trust or school.
- You can only use income from temporary or zero hours contracts where it's not the primary income of the applicant. There must be another form of income which is higher. This can include employed, self-employed, or pension income.

As proof of temporary employment income, we need the latest P60 and most recent payslip. Take the income from the most recent payslip and calculate income over a year. Compare this to the latest P60 total and use the smaller amount as income.

#### Fixed term contracts

This is where a job is only for a set period, although the contract may be renewed or extended. For example, parental leave cover.

#### Applicants must:

- have been employed on a fixed term contract basis for a minimum of 12 months **or** have at least 24 months remaining on their current contract.
- not have gaps between contracts of more than 12 total weeks in the past 12 months.
- provide a copy of the current employment contract as proof of income and employment.

If the current contract is unlikely to be renewed, we'll consider:

- length of time with current employer
- if the contract has been renewed before
- remaining term of the current contract
- their prospects for new employment in the same type of work at a similar salary
- if the contract is connected to a specific project.

If your client is employed on a fixed term contract and invoices the employer via a Limited Company that they're not the sole director/shareholder of, we will treat them as self-employed. See our Contractors section for more details.

#### NHS staff

You should treat Trainee/Junior NHS staff as permanent employees. This includes, but isn't limited to, specialty registrars, trainee nurses, and foundation/training doctors.

#### Piecework/Pricework

If an employee is paid at a fixed rate per unit produced or action performed, this is piecework or pricework. We can assess this using the temporary worker/zero hours contract criteria.

#### Applicants must:

- have been employed on this basis for at least 12 months with the same employer.
- You can only use income from temporary or zero hours contracts where it's not the primary income of the applicant. There must be another form of income which is higher. This can include employed, self-employed, or pension income.

If your client's piecework or pricework contract includes a minimum number of guaranteed hours or states that their income won't fall below the National Minimum Wage, we can:

- Treat the guaranteed element as basic income.
- Treat anything over and above the guaranteed element as overtime.
- Waive the 12 month minimum time with employer requirement.
- Key the applicant as permanent or employed.

To do this, you must provide a copy of the applicant's employment contract, along with the latest 3 months' payslips.

### Contractors

#### Employed contractors

Where an applicant is a contractor and has been trading on a self-employed basis for two or more years, their income can be considered as self-employed or as employed.

#### Treating a contractor as employed

- key as 'employed' on a fixed term contract.
- include the full income amount on the contract.

#### Limited Company contractor treated as employed

A self-employed contractor who has a Limited Company can choose to be treated as employed. Additional criteria apply in some scenarios.

#### Joint applications

- Where the contractor's Limited Company is in their **sole name**, income from their latest contract can be used.
- Where the contractor's Limited Company is in the **joint names** of both applicants, income from one applicant's latest contract can be used, but not both. No income from the limited company can be used for the other applicant.

#### Umbrella companies

If the applicant has 12 months working via an umbrella company we will treat them as a fixed term contractor.

The umbrella company must deduct full PAYE tax and National Insurance.

With effect from 30 June 2021, where applicants have been employed less than 12 months via a UK based Umbrella Company they must be able to prove a minimum 12 months continuous consecutive Fixed Term Contract history to meet our criteria.

- Applicants should be keyed as a Fixed Term Contractor with the umbrella company keyed as the employer.
- As salary, you must key the 'day rate' x 'no of days' x '52 weeks'
- If the umbrella company has listed expenses separately to the earned income, then only the earned income should be used.

#### Proofs

- We need to see the employment contract between the applicant and the Umbrella Company.
- If the contract does not show their income, we also require a letter from the Umbrella Company confirming the last 12 months earnings paid to the applicant.
- If 12 months proof of earnings is not available, we'll accept a letter from the Umbrella Company confirming the start date, daily/hourly rate and number of days/hours worked.

### Employment status

In some circumstances, we may need to see more information about your client's employment.

#### First job

**Clients who have been in their first job for one month or less**

We'll need to see:

- Latest payslip (you can only use basic income)
- If they do not have their first payslip yet, use their open-ended employment contract or letter of appointment from the employer addressed to the applicant

**Clients starting a new job within three months of application**

We'll consider clients who are starting a new job with a different employer within three months of applying for a mortgage. For example, an applicant applies for a mortgage in July and is starting their new job in September.

We'll need to see the signed open-ended employment contract, **or** a letter of appointment from the employer.

#### Pay rises

Is your client expecting a pay rise that's not reflected in their latest payslip?

For example, you apply in June and their pay rise will take effect in August of the same year.

We'll need to see a letter addressed to the applicant from their employer confirming their new basic income.

#### Probation

We'll consider clients working in a probation period.

#### Seafarers Earning Deduction

If your client works on a ship outside the UK and claims Seafarers Earning Deduction, we may need more information.

**Employed**

Where the latest payslip shows no UK tax and/or NI deduction, we'll need to see:

The latest UK tax calculation and corresponding tax year overview which shows no UK tax has been charged or paid. **Or**

An employer letter on headed paper confirming that:

### Self-employed applicants

A self-employed applicant may be:

- Umbrella Companies
- Sub-contractors
- Foster carers
- Seafarers Earning Deduction (SED)
*If a client has a 20% or less shareholding, we will treat them as 'employed' and use their payslip(s) to confirm income as appropriate. If the payslip income is not enough to support the loan requested, we will treat them as self-employed, for example where we need to take account of any dividend income. If dividend income is being used, please key as more than 20% shareholder.
Directors of a limited company Please contact us if your client is an existing Nationwide borrower and can’t meet the required criteria as some applications can be referred to our senior underwriters.: We'll need to see the last 2 years' income, where we'll either use the lower of the most recent year's salary and dividends or the average of the last 2 years' salary and dividends. This can be confirmed via our HMRC tax assessment or an accountant's certificate . The latest years end can't be more than 18 months ago.  Drafts and projections aren't acceptable. If the last accounting period is greater than 12 months, the income figures will be annualised.
Directors who have been self-employed for less than two years Please contact us if your client is an existing Nationwide borrower and has been self-employed for less than two years but is working as part of a business that has been established for longer, as some applications can be referred to our senior underwriters.: Where your client has been self-employed for less than two years but is working as part of a business that has been established for longer and now owns a share of the business or has become a partner in the firm. A letter from the Senior Partner, Accountant or Practice Manager is required that: confirms the partnership is well established the date the applicant became a partner and their expected income in the next 12 months. The most common of these scenarios is where an employed solicitor, doctor, accountant or architect, has recently been invited to become a partner in the firm they work for.
Self-employed applicants: A minimum trading period of 2 years is required. Income from applicants who are self-employed outside of the UK is unacceptable.
Sole traders and partnerships: We'll need the last 2 years' income and we use the lower of the most recent year's net profit (or share of), or the average of the last 2 years' net profit (or share of) figures.
Fixed term contractors Where an applicant is a fixed term contractor, or uses a payroll solution/umbrella company and their employer/payroll solution/umbrella company deducts full PAYE tax and National Insurance, please refer to employed fixed term contracts . You must key the 'day rate' x 'no of days' x '52 weeks' and the calculator will work out the maximum borrowing amount.: Where an applicant is a fixed term contractor and has been trading on a self-employed basis for two or more years, their income can be considered in either of the following ways: as self-employed, assessing the last two years' income using 100% of either; the lower of the most recent year, or the average of the last 2 years' figures, or as employed, subject to the applicant being keyed as 'employed' on a fixed term contract and the full amount of income on the contract.
Where an applicant is a fixed term contractor, but has been trading on a self-employed basis for less than two years, income can be considered subject to: the applicant being a fixed term contractor for at least 12 months, or, if less than 12 months having at least 24 months remaining on their current contract, and the applicant being keyed as 'employed' on a fixed term contract and the full amount of income on the contract.

In addition, the following requirements are applicable for cases where a self-employed fixed term contractor has a limited company, but chooses to be treated as employed. Sole application: Where the fixed term contractor's limited company is in more than the sole applicants name, the case may only proceed on a self-employed basis with income verified by HMRC documents or an accountants certificate. The applicant must have been self-employed for a minimum of 2 years. Joint application: Where the fixed term contractor's limited company is in their sole name, income from their latest contract can be used. Where the fixed term contractor's limited company is in the joint names of both applicants, income from their latest contract can be used, provided no other income from the limited company is used for the second applicant. Where the fixed term contractor's limited company is in more than one name and the names don't exactly match the application then the relevant applicant(s) can only proceed on a self-employed basis with income verified by HMRC documents or an accountants certificate. The applicant(s) must have been self-employed for a minimum of 2 years. For example, for a joint remortgage application where the fixed term contractor's limited company is in the names of both applicants and a third person, the case may only proceed with the fixed term contractor keyed as self-employed. There is no requirement to provide details of the fixed term contractor’s limited company unless requested by Nationwide.
Umbrella Companies If the applicant has 12 months working via an umbrella company we will treat them as a fixed term contractor (FTC). With effect from 30 June 2021, where applicants have been employed less than 12 months via a UK based Umbrella Company they must be able to prove a minimum 12 months continuous consecutive Fixed Term Contract history to meet our FTC criteria. Applicants should be keyed as a Fixed Term Contractor (FTC) with the umbrella company keyed as the employer. You must key the 'day rate' x 'no of days' x '52 weeks' and the calculator will work out the maximum borrowing amount. If the umbrella company has listed expenses separately to the earned income, then only the earned income should be used.: The proof requirement for FTC’s employed via an Umbrella Company is the employment contract between the applicant and the Umbrella Company. We require a letter from the Umbrella Company confirming the last 12 months earnings paid to the applicant. This is where the contract does not show the FTC income. Where 12 months proof of earnings is not available, we'll accept a letter from the Umbrella Company confirming the start date, daily/hourly rate and number of days/hours worked.
Sub-contractors who invoice their employer Sub-Contractors who work via their own Limited Company, Partnership or as a sole trader are treated as self-employed.: Where a Sub-Contractor is working as an individual, only basic rate tax (currently 20% for registered, or 30% for unregistered subcontractors) is deducted by the employer; this is commonly seen as a CIS deduction on the payslip. In these cases the applicant should be treated as self-employed and cannot be treated as a Fixed Term Contractor. If a Sub Contractor’s employer deducts full PAYE tax and National Insurance, please refer to employed fixed term contracts .
Foster carers: A letter from the agency or body that places the child confirming the total income paid for the last two years and that the income is likely to continue at the same level for the foreseeable future
Seafarers Earning Deduction (SED): Self employed income guidance applies. We'll also require the latest 2 years UK tax calculations and corresponding tax year overviews. The latest tax year overview must show no UK tax has been charged or paid.
Please contact us if your client is an existing Nationwide borrower and can’t meet the required criteria as some applications can be referred to our senior underwriters.
- We'll need to see the last 2 years' income, where we'll either use the lower of the most recent year's salary and dividends or the average of the last 2 years' salary and dividends. This can be confirmed via our HMRC tax assessment or an accountant's certificate .
- The latest years end can't be more than 18 months ago.  Drafts and projections aren't acceptable. If the last accounting period is greater than 12 months, the income figures will be annualised.

- confirms the partnership is well established
- the date the applicant became a partner and their expected income in the next 12 months.
The most common of these scenarios is where an employed solicitor, doctor, accountant or architect, has recently been invited to become a partner in the firm they work for.
- A minimum trading period of 2 years is required.
Income from applicants who are self-employed outside of the UK is unacceptable.
- We'll need the last 2 years' income and we use the lower of the most recent year's net profit (or share of), or the average of the last 2 years' net profit (or share of) figures.
Where an applicant is a fixed term contractor, or uses a payroll solution/umbrella company and their employer/payroll solution/umbrella company deducts full PAYE tax and National Insurance, please refer to employed fixed term contracts .
You must key the 'day rate' x 'no of days' x '52 weeks' and the calculator will work out the maximum borrowing amount.
Where an applicant is a fixed term contractor and has been trading on a self-employed basis for two or more years, their income can be considered in either of the following ways:
- as self-employed, assessing the last two years' income using 100% of either; the lower of the most recent year, or the average of the last 2 years' figures, or
- as employed, subject to the applicant being keyed as 'employed' on a fixed term contract and the full amount of income on the contract.
Where an applicant is a fixed term contractor, but has been trading on a self-employed basis for less than two years, income can be considered subject to:

Sole application:
- Where the fixed term contractor's limited company is in more than the sole applicants name, the case may only proceed on a self-employed basis with income verified by HMRC documents or an accountants certificate. The applicant must have been self-employed for a minimum of 2 years.
Joint application:
- Where the fixed term contractor’s limited company is in their sole name, income from their latest contract can be used.
- Where the fixed term contractor’s limited company is in the joint names of both applicants, income from their latest contract can be used, provided no other income from the limited company is used for the second applicant.
Where the fixed term contractor’s limited company is in more than one name and the names don't exactly match the application then the relevant applicant(s) can only proceed on a self-employed basis with income verified by HMRC documents or an accountants certificate. The applicant(s) must have been self-employed for a minimum of 2 years.
For example, for a joint remortgage application where the fixed term contractor's limited company is in the names of both applicants and a third person, the case may only proceed with the fixed term contractor keyed as self-employed.
There is no requirement to provide details of the fixed term contractor’s limited company unless requested by Nationwide.
If the applicant has 12 months working via an umbrella company we will treat them as a fixed term contractor (FTC).

If the umbrella company has listed expenses separately to the earned income, then only the earned income should be used.
The proof requirement for FTC’s employed via an Umbrella Company is the employment contract between the applicant and the Umbrella Company. We require a letter from the Umbrella Company confirming the last 12 months earnings paid to the applicant. This is where the contract does not show the FTC income.
Where 12 months proof of earnings is not available, we'll accept a letter from the Umbrella Company confirming the start date, daily/hourly rate and number of days/hours worked.

In these cases the applicant should be treated as self-employed and cannot be treated as a Fixed Term Contractor.
If a Sub Contractor’s employer deducts full PAYE tax and National Insurance, please refer to employed fixed term contracts .

# Housing scheme criteria


## In this section we cover:

- Shared Ownership
- Forces Help to Buy
- Equity Share Loan (including Help to Buy Wales)
- First Homes
- Right to Buy Purchase

### Shared Ownership

Shared Ownership is where your clients can purchase at least 25% share of the property and pay rent for the remaining share. Your client can buy a share in a property under a lease, which could be from a registered social landlord, Housing Association or Local Authority, who will own the remaining share. They could then buy a larger share later at a price based on the value of the property at the time, a process called ‘staircasing’.
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
They'll own their share as leasehold under the terms of a Shared Ownership lease.
Scotland
They'll enter into an Occupancy Agreement with the Housing Association, who will own the remaining interest. This allows them to occupy the whole property and pay an occupancy payment.
We only lend if we have entered into a Co-Operation Agreement with the Housing Association. Agreement can be for:
- the property being purchased or remortgaged
- the street the property is in
- the development the property is on or,
- every development belonging to the Association.
It’s important that authority has been gained before submitting the application, please contact us to check if the agreement is acceptable.
Criteria
- The Land Registry must show the legal owner of the security property to be the Shared Ownership provider. A case will not be able to complete unless this is the case.
- Your clients solicitor or conveyancer must confirm to us that the shared ownership lease meets our scheme requirements (PDF, 355KB - opens in a new window) .
- Shared Ownership mortgages are available on all our standard products.
- We accept builder’s cashback and most builder incentives up to a maximum total value of 5%. See our New Build incentives section for more details.
- We won’t accept applications using certain schemes. These include Resale Price Covenant Scheme, Restrictive Covenants, Equity loan, Sheltered Housing or Right to Buy.
- We’ll consider Shared Ownership leases where your client has capped staircasing. For example, if your client has capped their maximum share limit at 80%.
- Your client must include the Shared Ownership rental figure as a monthly outgoing when considering affordability.
Maximum loan to value (LTV)
Your remortgage clients can capital raise up to 90% LTV to buy an additional share or the final share of their Shared Ownership property. This helps your clients on the road to full home ownership.
We’ll lend up to 90% LTV for your client to purchase their initial share. See the example below based on a 75/25 split (25% owned by shared ownership landlord)
- £100,000 - Full price/value
- £25,000 - Amount retained by shared ownership landlord
- £75,000 - Price/value of the share
- £67,500 (90% of £75,000) - Maximum loan available
- £7,500 - 10% minimum required deposit
For more information, please read our LTV and maximum loan size and LTV limits criteria. Please note some conditions apply.
Shared Ownership with additional borrowing
If your client wishes to include additional borrowing, we'll only consider it for the following loan purposes:
- structural and non-structural home improvements
- buy additional or final share (staircasing)
- buy out partner’s interest (non-borrower).
We won’t accept additional borrowing for debt consolidation.
Applying
Standard ownership cases
You can submit a case on NFI Online (opens in a new window) . Please ensure you select ‘Shared Ownership’ (even if your client is purchasing the final share).
Remortgage Shared Ownership cases
When keying a Remortgage Shared Ownership case, select ‘Shared Ownership’ under ownership type. This will be for all cases including those that require additional borrowing to purchase an additional share or the final share.
In the 'Loan Requirements' screen, you'll need to enter your clients estimated current condition value of the share they'll own on completion. This is calculated using the percentage share they'll own (including any new purchased share) against their estimated open market value and your clients estimated open market value in current condition. NFI Online uses these values to calculate the percentage share that your client will own.

### Forces Help to Buy

Forces Help to Buy (FHTB) helps armed forces personnel to borrow up to 50% of their salary to go towards a deposit to buy their first home or move to another property and is interest free. This all depends on assignments and family circumstances.
Your clients will be able to borrow up to £25,000 to use towards a deposit of a new home, or solicitors and agent fees. They will then pay back the loan over ten years through their monthly salary.

You'll need to complete a DIP via NFI Online (opens in a new window) using the required purchase price and loan amount. Don't enter this as a New Build application or enter the security address. You'll need to select ‘Property not yet found’. This will allow you to get a DIP decision for your client, so you can refer the First Homes application to the Local authority.

# Valuation policy and fees


## In this section we cover:

- Valuations
- Valuation reports
- Home Surveys
- Valuation fees
- Valuation appeals
- Post Valuation queries reports
- Additional borrowing valuation
- Scottish Valuation Instructions
- Additional information

### Valuations

We’re legally obliged to assess the value of a property for mortgage purposes. This may not involve a physical inspection of the property. If the property is a New Build, the valuation report will be uploaded to the document store within NFI Online (opens in a new window) . For other applications, we’ll only release a copy of the valuation report in exceptional circumstances.
Your clients are advised to get their own report on the condition and value of the property. We would advise a fuller inspection, such as a Home Survey level 2 or 3 report .
Please note that once the valuation has been produced, you can't request a Home Survey report.
If you're unsure whether the property would be suitable security for us, you can complete this Pre-valuation enquiry form .
Property decision at DIP
In some cases, we'll have enough information on the property at DIP to decide we wouldn't be prepared to lend. For example, if the property is in a known flood area. This will show on the DIP results screen.
- If your client decides to purchase a different property, you'll be able to amend the DIP.
- If you want to challenge the property decision, complete the DIP property decline form . To consider this challenge, you'll need to provide evidence/a valid reason for your challenge.
Once we receive the instructed valuation and the application is sent, we'll process the documents within our expected SLAs .
We need to underwrite some higher risk cases in more detail. To prevent delays for your clients, please see our key information for DIP refer cases .

### Valuation reports

Mortgage Valuation Report (MVR) / Further Advance Revaluation Report (FARR)
Where we require a physical valuation, safety is our number one priority. Valuers will need to carry out a detailed safety assessment with the customer before we conduct the valuation. Where a customer isn’t comfortable letting a valuer into their property we’ll place the application on hold. You’ll need to tell us when they’re ready to proceed.
Valuers may carry out an ‘external only’ assessment. They will still complete a safety assessment and the valuer will explain the process to the customer. Where we need more information or require photos of the property, the valuer will request them from the applicant/vendor. If this is necessary, we will provide full support by telephone/email.
We’ll carry out a valuation to ensure the property is suitable for mortgage purposes. It’s important to note:
- Your client won't get a copy of the report.
- The mortgage valuation may not involve a physical inspection or visit to the property. For example, we may use an Automated Valuation Model (AVM) or desktop valuation.
- You must not rely on the report to identify defects in the property. There may be defects that will not be on the report for mortgage lending purposes, but which could be important to your client as the buyer. For their own purposes, your client should consider obtaining either a Home Survey Level 2 Report or a Home Survey Level 3 Report .

### Home Surveys

Home Survey Level 2 Report
- A member of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) will carry out this report.
- The RICS states you should choose this report when you need more extensive information when buying a conventional house, flat or bungalow. This home will need to be built from common building materials and in reasonable condition.
- The focus of the report is assessing the general condition of the main elements of the property. This includes a visual inspection of the building, its grounds and its services (although we won't test the services).
- If it’s safe to do so, we'll inspect concealed areas opened or used by the occupiers. For example roof spaces, basements and cellars.
- The report will provide an assessment of the relative importance of any defects/problems.
Read more about the Level 2 RICS report
Home Survey Level 3 Report
- The RICS states you should choose this report if
- dealing with a large, older or run-down property
- a building that is unusual or altered, or
- if you're planning major works.
- It costs more because it gives detailed information about the structure and fabric of the property.
- The service includes an extensive detailed visual inspection of the building, its services and the grounds. It provides more extensive details than a Level 2 Survey. Although the services aren’t tested, we'll observe them in normal operation. In other words, they're switched on or off and/or operated where the occupier has given permission. And it’s safe to do so.
- The report will describe the form of construction and materials used for different parts of the property. As well as the condition and provide an assessment of the relative importance of any defects/problems.
- It will describe any known risks of potential or hidden defects in areas not inspected. The report will propose the most probable cause(s) of the defects based on the inspection. It will outline the likely scope of any appropriate remedial work. And explain the likely issues of non-repair. The report will make general suggestions in respect of the priority and likely timescale for necessary work. The surveyor may be able to provide an estimate of costs for identified repairs if agreed in advance.
- dealing with a large, older or run-down property
- a building that is unusual or altered, or
- if you're planning major works.

If your client would like a Home Survey Level 3 Report:
- You or your client can email us at FullBuildingSurvey@Nationwide.co.uk . You should do this as soon as you submit your case. This will need to include your client’s name and mortgage case reference number .
- We’ll email straight back to say we’ve received the request. And that we’ll provide a further update within 48 hours.
- Once we've allocated the MVR, we’ll contact the valuation firm to confirm your client would like a Home Survey Level 3 Report.
- We’ll email you or your client (depending on who emailed us for the Home Survey Level 3 Report request) to confirm the valuation’s been placed. We'll then contact your client by the valuation firm regarding their Home Survey Level 3 Report.
- Your client will need to pay the Home Survey Level 3 Report fee direct to the valuation firm. Your client can approach a different company to get a Home Survey Level 3 Report quote.
- You're not required to enter any notes regarding the Home Survey Level 3 Report on NFI Online.

### Valuation fees

We’re legally obliged to assess the value of a property for mortgage purposes. This may not involve a physical inspection of the property. If the property is a New Build, the valuation report will be uploaded to the document store within NFI Online. For other applications, we’ll only release a copy of the valuation report in exceptional circumstances.
Your clients are advised to get their own report on the condition and value of the property. We would advise a fuller inspection, such as a Home Survey Level 2 Report or a Home Survey Level 3 Report .
All products come with a free Level 1 Mortgage Valuation. Costs vary for each level of survey based on the property value. Read our table below.

If you or your client wish to appeal the property valuation figure returned by NFI Online as part of a rate switch application, please complete the Rate Switch Valuation Appeal Form . You'll then need to email this to switchervaluationappeals@nationwide.co.uk .

### Post Valuation queries reports

Valuers may request specialist reports within their valuation which are:
- designed to highlight defects
- and/or to assist them in obtaining additional information upon which to base their valuation.
The valuer will advise which reports they need. A surveyor will then need to complete all the requested reports. Once completed, you'll need to upload them to the case, so we can refer them back to the valuer for their consideration. We'll only accept reports from qualified firms and professions, and they must show a proper detailed inspection has been made. The initial report might certify that the property is not a suitable security. If this happens we may consider it following an independent review by a specialist.
The following are examples of specialist reports that we might request:
Structural Engineers Report: Valuers may require this specialist report to consider if a property is suitable security and if there's any required works which could impact the value. For a structural report to be acceptable it must: be dated within the last 90 days be for the whole property and have comment(s) on any specific issues which the valuer has identified be addressed to the applicant and in both names if this is a joint mortgage application. If the report is addressed to a third party (for example the person selling the property), the author of the report must confirm in writing that the applicant, lender (Nationwide) and professional advisers can rely on its contents. The report must be on appropriate letter headed paper. It must indicate that the Structural Engineer holds one of the below qualifications: Standard - MICE / FICE / AMI Struct E / MI Struct E / FI Struct E Chartered Building Surveyor - MRICS / FRICS Corporate Building/Corporate Structural Engineer - MASI / FASI / MCABE / FCABE / MCIOB / FCIOB / MIEI (Members of Engineers Ireland).
Damp and timber report: Valuers may require this specialist report to consider if a property is suitable security and if there's any required works which could impact the value. The report must be for the whole property and dated within the last 90 days. If remedial damp treatment works are required to the property, your client must have cover with a 10-year insurance backed guarantee. Any guarantee issued must be in the name of the applicants, and/or transferable to new owners.
Loft and basement conversions: The valuer might decline the property if they have concerns with the basement conversion, attic conversion or loft room. To consider the property as suitable security, you need to provide one of the following: An original Building Regulations completion certificate A Regularisation Certificate A Chartered Building Surveyor's report with specific comment on the structural integrity of the conversion. And means of escape and provision of adequate pre-warning (alarm) system. This report should include any required work which you'll need to carry out to improve the safety of the conversion, along with an estimated cost. A declaration from the applicant accepting that, due to the Health and Safety and Fire Risk concerns, they'll not be using the attic space as a place to live. This is not appropriate if the non-compliant converted areas are essential to the accommodation. An example being the Kitchen or the only bedroom within a property.
Electrical report: We may require an electrical report if the wiring is old or the property has been extended significantly at some point in the past. An inspection will involve the testing of all electrical wiring by a qualified electrician: England & Wales - NICEIC, STORMA or NAPIT registered electricians Scotland & Northern Ireland - NICEIC registered electricians
Valuers may require this specialist report to consider if a property is suitable security and if there's any required works which could impact the value.
For a structural report to be acceptable it must:
- be dated within the last 90 days
- be for the whole property and have comment(s) on any specific issues which the valuer has identified

### Additional borrowing valuation

You can input an estimated value of your client's property on the loan requirements screen.
We’ll attempt to value the property using either:
- an Automated Valuation Model
- or a Further Advance Revaluation Report (which'll involve a physical inspection of the property).
If you're completing a rate switch application at the same time as an additional borrowing application, you can input an estimated property value in the loan requirements screen of the additional borrowing application. This will not change the value we hold for the rate switch application.
Please follow the valuation appeal process below if you wish to appeal the valuation for:
- a rate switch application
- or following a physical inspection.
See our additional borrowing page .

### Scottish Valuation Instructions

Home Reports in Scotland - Single Surveys
All vendors of a residential property in Scotland must provide potential purchasers with a copy of a Home Report Pack. This will contain:
- a Single Survey
- an Energy Report
- a Property Questionnaire
- and a generic Mortgage Valuation report.
If you're unsure whether the property would be suitable security for us, you can complete a Pre-valuation enquiry form [https://www.nationwide-intermediary.co.uk/-/media/nfi/documents/f1254-valuation-instruction-form.pdf?rev=2286745d7691460eb498104064de5821&hash=715A14F50B177D8999A3FB1B2BDF2CD4].
Transcriptions
The only transcriptions accepted are purchase mortgages arranged under the Scottish Home Report (single survey) process. We won't accept transcriptions for remortgage applications and those relating to New Build properties.
For acceptance of these transcriptions the following points apply:
- The valuer providing the transcription must be the person who prepared the original Home Report or inspected the new property.
- The firm employing the valuer must be on the Nationwide panel.
- The valuation figure can't be older than 90 days from the date of inspection.
- Where the valuation figure is a result of a 'refresh' of the original Home Report, you must make sure it's based on an internal/external inspection that has taken place within the last 90 days.
The transcript will only contain the same information and valuation figure as the Single Survey. A valuer may, at the request of the seller, refresh the report which could result in changes, including the valuation figure. To refresh a report the valuer must re-inspect the property.
Nationwide will instruct valuers to forward transcripts only if they have inspected (or re-inspected) the property within 3 months from receipt of our instructions.
Instructing valuation
- Where a Single Survey has been prepared by a panel valuer, you need to request a transcription. You can do this via NFI Online in the usual way.
- Countrywide surveyors will reject where they:
- receive the transcript requests, but the valuer isn't on our panel.
- receive the instruction request but can't issue a transcript.
- receive the transcript requests, but the valuer isn't on our panel.
- receive the instruction request but can't issue a transcript.
Where you can't provide a transcription, we'll let you know. We'll then arrange a standard valuation.
Exempt properties
You'll be exempt from the requirement to have a Home Report Pack or single survey if you plan to occupy the newly converted properties as residential units for the first time.
Scottish Valuation Instructions
Open Market Sale (non-New Build): Yes
New Build Purchase: N/A
Remortgages: No
Non Open Market Sale - Private/Family Sale/Right to buy etc: No
Transcripts of home reports are acceptable for open market purchases providing the surveyor is on Nationwide's panel. If the surveyor who prepared the original home report is not on Nationwide's panel, then Nationwide must instruct the valuation.
You must have had carried out the original home report prior to the date of the mortgage application. It is acceptable, for any required refresh to have a date after the mortgage application. Transcripts are not acceptable where the transaction is not an open market purchase. For example Private sale/family sale/right to buy, even if there is a home report in existence. Please see further home report notes above.
Nationwide must instruct the valuation in all New Build cases. Even if there is a valuation available for a transcription.
Remortgages
- home report transcript or
- self-instructed valuation for remortgages.
Non Open Market
To read more about our Scottish criteria, see our dedicated page .

### Additional information

We offer free standard valuations on all purchase, remortgage and additional borrowing (further advance) products.
Remortgage applications
- When your client transfers their mortgage to us from another lender, we check the value of the property. To minimise costs for your client we pay the fee for a standard mortgage valuation.
Equity Share, Shared Ownership and Restricted Resale Price applications
- We'll base the valuation fee on the full open market value of the property.

#### Valuation updates

You can check the status and the details of a valuation. This includes instruction, inspection and the report received dates on NFI Online.

### Concessionary Purchase/Genuine Bargain Price

Concessionary Purchase/Genuine Bargain Price is where the property is knowingly being purchased by your client below the market value. The purchase can't be part of a recognised scheme such as Right to Buy or Shared Ownership.
Applications where solicitors are recording the purchase price as the full market value should be keyed as standard with a gift of equity as deposit.
Only applications that are recorded by the solicitor at the reduced price should be keyed as Genuine Bargain Price.
Acceptable scenarios
- Interfamily sale (buying from a relative)
- Employee buying from their employer

Restricted Resale Price is where a property is sold at a percentage of open market value.
This will be considered by Nationwide where the property is sold at a defined percentage of the full unrestricted open market value. Any other means of assessing the property price isn't acceptable.
Your client should know what percentage price restriction applies. It is recommended your client seeks advice from their solicitor/conveyancer who can check our Low Cost Home Ownership requirements before submitting their application.

# Property and construction

This section of the site gives you details of our property and construction lending criteria:

## In this section we cover:

- Construction types
- Lending for flats
- Building warranties
- Tenure
- Part Commercial Properties
- Properties with Large Acreage
- Estate Charges
- Geographical Area
- Fire safety assessment

### Construction types

Traditional Construction (Normal lending terms apply): Walls Cavity outer walls of brick/reconstituted stone/block (including rendered walls) with inner walls of brick or block. Timber framed property with outer walls of brick/reconstituted stone/block (including rendered walls), built 1970 or after. Solid stone (e.g. limestone, granite). Cob - or any regional variant (for example cobb, clom and Wychert). Roof Tile (concrete) Slate Thatch (reed or straw) Felt, asphalt Copper, lead Spray Foam Insulation If spray foam insulation has been fitted in the wall voids of the property, then the valuer will decline the property. The valuer will decline the property at first, where spray foam has been installed in the rafters, frame, and/or underfloor structure. However, we'll reconsider with evidence of either: Confirmation the installation of the foam is in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations, and The full pre-survey suitability report including details of the materials/isolating card The condensation risk assessment Evidence of BBA certification The warranty/guarantee provided of the installation and insulation. This warranty must be transferable upon sale of the property to the new owners. Or A Chartered Building Survey (FRICS or MRICS qualified) should be instructed to undertake an invasive inspection. They'll need to report on the frame integrity. Where it requires remediation or foam removal work, you will need to include an estimated cost.
Non -Traditional Construction: There are many properties built using a variety of other construction methods. Lending terms vary depending on construction types and if a repair scheme, where appropriate, has been used. Please contact your usual Service Centre where a property is of non-traditional construction with the following details for further advice: The name of the type of construction Year built (if known) Flat/terrace/semi or detached Details of any repair scheme if appropriate and if the scheme applies to the whole block (e.g. the whole terrace/both semis) The exact construction name is important as lending terms may differ between different types and year built. For example, our lending terms differ between Gregory, Gregory Drury System 3 and Gregory Housing. All three have different lending terms, and it is important to ensure you give us the  full and accurate name to avoid us giving  incorrect advice.
Modern Methods of Construction: We're supportive of development schemes which incorporate Modern Methods of Construction (MMC). Although an MMC scheme must display sufficient robustness, technical rigour and suitability for its location. Due to the wide and changing range of products in the market, we now treat independently each development (not system). Please provide the full information below to enable us to consider your development: Principal construction materials - e.g. steel frame, timber frame, CLT (Cross Laminated Timber) Details of the roof and wall finishes - you will need to provide confirmation/evidence of their British Board of Agrément (BBA) or similar accreditation. This should be for a minimum of a 30 year lifespan (including fixings) Warranty details - this should be a mainstream warranty accepted by Nationwide (preferably “NHBC Accepts”). We also require confirmation whether the system has Buildoffsite Property Assurance Scheme (BOPAS) accreditation Any available site specific information regarding the development .
Solar Panels: We'll lend on a security with an Airspace Lease providing it meets the minimum requirements documented in the UK Finance Lenders' Handbook (opens in a new window) . Or where the vendor owns the panels. Other arrangements are not acceptable.
Duplex Properties: The word duplex can be used to denote several property types. Below you can see the circumstances for each one: It can refer to a specific structure type e.g. Duplex Foamed Slag. Maisonettes are where there are two leasehold properties each covering two storeys in a block of four storeys. However, in some developments they are referred to as duplex houses/maisonettes. These buildings can sometimes be known by the name of "Over and Under" properties. They were built up to four or five storeys high in steep hillside terrace form, on a similar arrangement to maisonettes, with each property having ground level access. Some involved back to back arrangements. Construction is normally of stone and quality of construction varies from poor to very good. Essentially these properties are flying freeholds, and normally would not form an acceptable security for the Society. However, the Society will accept these Duplex properties provided the following procedures are strictly adhered to: Prior to valuation, the conveyancer must confirm the property is in an area covered by the West Yorkshire Act 1980. The valuer has strict criteria to judge that the Duplex properties are acceptable.
Japanese Knotweed: We will consider properties with caution any Japanese Knotweed growing within the vicinity. They will be subject to the following terms: If Japanese Knotweed is: actually causing visible material damage to a structure, OR not actually causing visible material damage, but is still likely to prevent use of or access to amenity space, OR visible on adjoining land, but is evidently unmanaged and has the potential to significantly impact the subject property/grounds Then the applicant will be required to obtain a specialist report in respect of eradicating the plant. This will include an insurance backed 5-year warranty against re-appearance of the plant. If necessary, we'll require repairs to the property and services for the valuer to make a full assessment of the property's suitability. However, if Japanese Knotweed: isn't causing visible material damage to a structure and not likely to prevent use of or restrict access to amenity space, OR is visible on adjoining land but managed with no potential to significantly impact the subject property/grounds. Then we'll require written confirmation from the applicant confirming that they're aware of the presence of this invasive plant. And that it could have adverse effects on the property should it spread closer. The applicant should seek their own independent professional advice regarding the risk this plant might impose.
Walls
- Cavity outer walls of brick/reconstituted stone/block (including rendered walls) with inner walls of brick or block.
- Timber framed property with outer walls of brick/reconstituted stone/block (including rendered walls), built 1970 or after.
- Solid stone (e.g. limestone, granite).
- Cob - or any regional variant (for example cobb, clom and Wychert).
Roof
- Tile (concrete)
- Slate
- Thatch (reed or straw)
- Felt, asphalt
- Copper, lead
Spray Foam Insulation
If spray foam insulation has been fitted in the wall voids of the property, then the valuer will decline the property.
The valuer will decline the property at first, where spray foam has been installed in the rafters, frame, and/or underfloor structure. However, we'll reconsider with evidence of either:
Confirmation the installation of the foam is in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations, and
- The full pre-survey suitability report including details of the materials/isolating card
- The condensation risk assessment
- Evidence of BBA certification
- The warranty/guarantee provided of the installation and insulation. This warranty must be transferable upon sale of the property to the new owners.
Or
A Chartered Building Survey (FRICS or MRICS qualified) should be instructed to undertake an invasive inspection. They'll need to report on the frame integrity. Where it requires remediation or foam removal work, you will need to include an estimated cost.
Non -Traditional Construction
There are many properties built using a variety of other construction methods. Lending terms vary depending on construction types and if a repair scheme, where appropriate, has been used. Please contact your usual Service Centre where a property is of non-traditional construction with the following details for further advice:
- The name of the type of construction
- Year built (if known)
- Flat/terrace/semi or detached
- Details of any repair scheme if appropriate and if the scheme applies to the whole block (e.g. the whole terrace/both semis)
The exact construction name is important as lending terms may differ between different types and year built. For example, our lending terms differ between Gregory, Gregory Drury System 3 and Gregory Housing.

They were built up to four or five storeys high in steep hillside terrace form, on a similar arrangement to maisonettes, with each property having ground level access. Some involved back to back arrangements. Construction is normally of stone and quality of construction varies from poor to very good.
Essentially these properties are flying freeholds, and normally would not form an acceptable security for the Society. However, the Society will accept these Duplex properties provided the following procedures are strictly adhered to:
- Prior to valuation, the conveyancer must confirm the property is in an area covered by the West Yorkshire Act 1980.
The valuer has strict criteria to judge that the Duplex properties are acceptable.
Japanese Knotweed
We will consider properties with caution any Japanese Knotweed growing within the vicinity. They will be subject to the following terms:
If Japanese Knotweed is:
- actually causing visible material damage to a structure, OR
- not actually causing visible material damage, but is still likely to prevent use of or access to amenity space, OR
- visible on adjoining land, but is evidently unmanaged and has the potential to significantly impact the subject property/grounds
Then the applicant will be required to obtain a specialist report in respect of eradicating the plant. This will include an insurance backed 5-year warranty against re-appearance of the plant. If necessary, we'll require repairs to the property and services for the valuer to make a full assessment of the property's suitability.
However, if Japanese Knotweed:
- isn't causing visible material damage to a structure and not likely to prevent use of or restrict access to amenity space, OR
- is visible on adjoining land but managed with no potential to significantly impact the subject property/grounds.
Then we'll require written confirmation from the applicant confirming that they're aware of the presence of this invasive plant. And that it could have adverse effects on the property should it spread closer. The applicant should seek their own independent professional advice regarding the risk this plant might impose.

### Lending for flats

Non New Build Flats: The maximum LTV on non New Build flats (with a minimum lease term of 90 years) is: 95% for purchases 90% for remortgages
Blocks of flats up to five storeys high: All flats in blocks and Scottish tenements not exceeding five storeys* in height, will be acceptable at the discretion of the valuer. This is subject to the valuer accepting the guidelines and restrictions on non-traditional construction. The instructed valuer will then report on whether the flat satisfies our requirements in terms of construction, marketability and any other associated matters. Flats in blocks over 4 storeys high should have a lift. This also applies when the subject flat is on the lower floors. We can make some exceptions, but this is subject to marketability and valuers’ recommendation. *Five storeys means a ground floor with four floors above, ignoring any basement.

At Nationwide, the Building warranties we'll accept include:
- NHBC
- LABC
- Build-zone
- Premier Guarantee

* PCCs are acceptable for newly built homes within a development of no more than 10 units. A maximum of 4 units within the structure where they're within a continuous structure. For example, a row of terrace houses or block of flats. We'll require a PCC for newly converted or homes which have recently been significantly altered or refurbished. Retrospective certificates by a professional who has not supervised the project from the start and inspected the build at regular intervals are not acceptable.
** Nationwide will only accept a CRL New Build 10 year structural defects insurance policy in the following circumstances:
- The final certificate is dated 04/09/2019 or earlier, and the underwriter is International General Insurance Company (UK) Ltd (IGI) or CGICE

### Tenure

The maximum LTV on non New Build flats (with a minimum lease term of 90 years) is 95% for purchases and 90% for remortgages.
We'll lend on:
- Freehold - houses and bungalows
- Leasehold (including good leasehold title)
- Commonhold
- Ownership (Scotland)
- Flying Freehold (subject to confirmation from the valuer that the property is suitable security)

#### Minimum Leasehold Terms

Please note: if you're submitting an application for lending greater than 85%, please see our Higher LTV criteria and tips page for more details.
England and Wales: Flats and Houses - we require a minimum unexpired lease of 55 years at application. This along with a minimum unexpired lease term of 30 years after mortgage term ends. Where your client is looking to purchase a new longer lease or lease extension, we'll process the application using the details of the new/extended lease.

#### Tyneside leases

Where there’s only two flats in the building, an agreement known as a Tyneside lease may be in place. Under this, the two owners are each other's landlord and tenant.
This allows one owner to keep all the lease term agreements against the other, which is a basic requirement for leasehold properties.
These flats are acceptable as leasehold securities.

#### Lease Terms

- The valuer must be satisfied that there is a market for any property taking the lease term into consideration.
- Although an application may meet the guidelines above, the valuer may decline the property. For example a mortgage application in England for a 20-year term with a 56-year unexpired lease within policy. The valuer may advise the property is not readily marketable and saleable. In this instance we won't consider the property as suitable security.
- The valuer must confirm that there is a market for any property, taking into account the lease terms, which must be reasonable.
- Where the valuer believes the lease terms will impact the marketability. They may reflect this in their valuation, For example:
- Some lease terms will severely impact marketability that they will result in the decline of a property. For example:
- where ground rent is greater than or equal to 0.5% of the property value. Or where the review period is less than or equal to 5 years.
- where ground rent doubles in less than 20 years (e.g. every 5, 10 or 15 years). Or escalates by compounded RPI.
- where ground rent is greater than or equal to 0.5% of the property value. Or where the review period is less than or equal to 5 years.
- where ground rent doubles in less than 20 years (e.g. every 5, 10 or 15 years). Or escalates by compounded RPI.
For lending restrictions, please see our Maximum LTV and loan for New Build properties section for detail.
These examples aren’t exhaustive. The solicitor is expected to refer back to us any lease terms they feel may affect the value or future sale ability of the security.
Service Charges greater than 1% of property value per annum will be referred to the valuer.
Please note: there are different limits for acceptable New Build Lease Terms. See our New Build page for detail.

### Fire safety assessment

The valuer will decline the property if it has:

- non-cladding related fire safety concerns with external wall systems and any attachment (e.g. balconies)
- or any other significant fire safety concerns in a multi-storey, multi-occupancy buildings.

#### Why do we ask for more information before mortgage offer?

It’s important that you highlight and address with your client any fire safety issues with the property as soon as possible.
This means if we’re able to give them a mortgage offer, they can be more confident these issues won’t arise later in their mortgage journey. For example when they’re close to completion.

#### What happens next?

Governments of each jurisdiction have introduced different legislation and requirements to address fire safety concerns.
We’ll need some more information to decide if the property is suitable. Our requirements will depend on:
- the location (jurisdiction) of the property, (i.e. England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland)
- the height of the building
- whether the property’s fire safety issues are going to be remediated and/or mitigated. Or, for example, whether they're being refuted by the Principal Accountable Person (the person responsible for repairing and reporting on common parts of the building).

#### Our requirements for cases affected by fire safety issues

We'll contact you if a valuer has declined a property due to fire safety concerns that need to be investigated. We'll know the jurisdiction and height of the building. However, you’ll need to know whether the property’s fire safety issues are going to be remediated and/or mitigated. For example, whether the building is being remediated under the Developer Pledge.
So we can review the property further, once you have identified the relevant remediation/mitigation route for the building, please use the guidance below, so you know what information to send us.
If a free legal fee product is selected and the valuer raises concerns about fire safety on a property, we can't proceed on a free legal fee basis. We'll contact you to let you know. A new product must be selected using solicitors from our panel.

### Our guidance

The Building Safety Act [2022] sets out clear obligations and protections in relation to high-rise multi-occupancy residential buildings. Many will have to undergo the remediation process. The protections offered under the Building Safety Act [2022] only relates to those living in high-rise blocks, defined as being 11 metres or more (or 5 storeys or more). Buildings under 11 metres (or 4 storeys or less) will have different requirements.

The Government has an agreement with the 'Department for Levelling Up Housing' and 'Communities (DLUHC)' for applications to be accepted to the Cladding Safety Scheme. England operates this scheme. They will only accept applications for buildings 11 metres or more (or 5 storeys or more). This means buildings under 11 metres (or 4 storeys or less) will have different requirements.
Please note: Neither the Building Safety Act [2022] or Developer Pledge apply in Northern Ireland.
Our requirements when dealing with Northern Ireland applications
The valuer will decline the property pending receipt of an EWS1 form (PDF, 200KB - opens in a new window) . Where a valuer has cladding or non-cladding fire safety concerns with external wall systems, attachments (e.g. Balconies), or any other significant fire safety concerns.
The form must be:
- obtained from the building owner. The ‘Client organisation’ on the form must be the building owner. We won't accept it in the name of the applicant/client.
- fully completed and accompanied by a headed paper letter from the signing firm which details
- their area of business
- qualifications
- confirmation that they've completed the form.
- their area of business
- qualifications
- confirmation that they've completed the form.
It's the duty of the building owner to ensure the signing firm is a member of an appropriate professional body. See the RICS website (opens in a new window) for more information.
The specialist will complete the form and select either ‘low risk’ or ‘high risk’ and will then choose a rating of either:
- A1, A2 and B1 - we’ll send the form to the valuer for assessment. If accepted, they’ll provide an amended valuation report.
- A3 or B2 - we’ll assess the case and let you know our decision. We may request confirmation from the building owner about the remedial building work required. And who’ll be liable for the cost of those works. For Scotland, we'll require confirmation from the building factors/managing agents acting for the co-proprietors.
For all application types where the building owner will cover the remedial costs, we’ll require confirmation in writing from the building owner that:
- you will compile the EWS1 requirements and render the building fire safe (i.e. fall within the definition of A1, A2 or B1) on completion of the remedial works.
- the interim fire safety measures are satisfactory.
- you will not pass on costs or hidden charges to the leaseholder (e.g. via service charges).
- remediation will take place within a reasonable timescale (12 months).
Where remedial costs fall to individual leaseholders/flat owners
For remortgage and purchase, if the building owner’s solicitors confirm in writing, we’ll consider applications where the owner has paid for and planned/started remedial works. We’ll decline any applications if remedial works have not yet been paid for or planned/started.
For further advances, we’ll consider applications if the funds are being raised to carry out the required remedial works. We'll require further information from the building owner to make an assessment, including:
- the compiled EWS1 requirements rendering the building fire safe (i.e. fall within the definition of A1, A2 or B1) on completion of the remedial works.
- confirmation the interim fire safety measures are satisfactory.
- a summary of the remedial works required and when the works will take place.
- costs the leaseholder/flat owner is liable for and when the required funds are due to be paid to the freeholder.
The Government has introduced consultation with the Housing (Cladding Remediation) (Scotland) Bill. They have also suggested amendments to the Building (Scotland) Act [2003]. This will pave the way in how impacted properties will be assessed and remediated in Scotland. These have not yet made their way into formal legislation.
Our requirements when dealing with Scottish applications

- remediation will take place within a reasonable timescale (12 months).
Where remedial costs fall to individual leaseholders/flat owners
For remortgage and purchase, if the building owner’s solicitors confirm in writing, we’ll consider applications where the owner has paid for and planned/started remedial works. We’ll decline any applications if remedial works have not yet been paid for or planned/started.

The Building Regulations 2018 banned the use of flammable materials on new high-rise homes. Any buildings started after 21 February 2019 should not contain flammable material.
We require an EWS1 form (PDF, 200KB - opens in a new window) for any New Build designed/constructed under the old regulations. This is regardless of storey height. For example, where there are concerns around wall systems and attachments.
We won’t require an EWS1 form for New Builds that have been/are being constructed in compliance with The Building Regulations 2018. Unless upon inspection, the valuer has concerns regarding other elements of fire safety.
We'll speak to the Developer/Sales Agent. If the valuer can’t confirm that the latest Building Regulations apply, we'll decline the mortgage valuation report. This is pending confirmation from the Building Owner/Developer/Conveyancer whether it’s compliant with The Building Regulations 2018.

The new solicitor must provide confirmation they're acting for the clients. They can do this by emailing the confirmation to postofferqueries@nationwide.co.uk , or sending a letter. Letters need to be in PDF format and addressed to 'Nationwide Building Society', containing the following details:
- Solicitors header/footer/logo

- they’re subject to ERCs.
Solicitors can visit the solicitors page (opens in a new window) on our customer website.

### Local Authority Search

We require conveyancers to carry out all the usual and necessary searches and enquiries.
A Local Authority Search protects both the applicant and ourselves. It can reveal matters such as future development plans for an area as well as existing planning consent for another property close by. It can flag whether the property is safe to live in or if it requires remediation works.

- Non New Build property purchase transactions – we require a completed local search in all circumstances. We don’t accept search insurance.
- Remortgage transactions – we don’t require a completed local search or require search insurance.
- New Build cases - where the local search carried out on the original plot of land has expired, we'll accept search insurance to cover any new risks that may have emerged since the local search was carried out.

# Scottish criteria


## In this section we cover:

- The process
- Scottish address formats and proofs
- Shared Equity
- Shared Ownership
- Scottish Islands
- Glossary
The process for purchasing a property in Scotland is different to the process in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

### The process

In Scotland, properties sold on the open market often utilise an ‘offers over’ process, where a seller can determine a selling price and invite prospective buyers to submit offers at or around that price. This can be at, above or below the figure in the Home Report . If there’s been more than one bid, a ‘closing date' can be set or the seller can opt to accept the most preferable offer. Where a closing date has been arranged, the seller can decide on the most suitable offer received, usually the highest bidder. Then the missives process takes place, with a completion date agreed. The successful bidder will have secured the property once  missives are concluded.
A ‘fixed price’ approach can also be applied by the seller. Where a suitable purchase buyer offers the fixed price, they'll then secure the property once the missives have been concluded. The fixed price doesn’t necessarily need to be the same as the valuation figure contained within the Home Report .
In order to get the correct product and LTV (where agreed purchase price is different from the Home Report figure) you should key the application with the lower of the valuation or the purchase price. Then contact us to update the purchase price to the correct amount. If it’s already lower than the market value we won't need to update it.
You can also complete the above by uploading a Material Change Form to the application, the form must clearly confirm the purchase price and source of additional deposit (if any).

### Scottish address formats and proofs

When finding your client’s address, you should check what address NFI Online returns first. If this doesn't match the proof that you have, then you should use the ‘Enter Manually’ option. Your client should check what address format they hold with one of the following Credit Reference Agencies; TransUnion, Equifax or Experian.
We’ll only request proof of name and address where your client isn’t automatically verified when applying. UK Passport and UK Driving Licences can be used as both name AND address ID on the same application. We’ll ask for an acceptable proof of address (on receipt) if the documents show an undeclared address.
Address format variants on proofs, such as flats, may  be accepted after assessment. For more information, please contact us .

### Shared Equity

All Shared Equity schemes need to be checked by the acting conveyancer against the UK Finance Mortgage Lenders’ Handbook (opens in a new window) . Please see our low cost home ownership schemes guide (PDF, 355kB - opens in a new window) for more information.
In Scotland, the LIFT (Low Income for First Time Buyers) scheme is supported and will be classed as shared equity. However, we won’t accept schemes with a Golden Share element .

### Shared Ownership

Please see our Shared Ownership section .

### Scottish Islands

For a list of Scottish Islands we'll consider lending on, please see our Geographical Area section.

### Glossary


### Tenure

Most of the land has historically been held under what is known as Feudal Tenure. There is a co-ordinated programme of Property Law reform to replace Feudal Tenure with outright / absolute ownership. This is referred to as ‘Ownership Scotland’ in NFI Online (Freehold Tenure in Scotland doesn’t exist, and Leasehold tenure is uncommon).

### Home Report

Under Scottish Property Law the seller is required to get a Home Report on the property being sold before it is placed on the market. There are three sections within a Home Report; the Property Questionnaire, a Single Survey and an Energy Report.
We’ll accept a transcript of the Single Survey section, which will be automatically requested on NFI Online once the FMA has been completed. Home Reports are valid for 90 days from, and including, the date of inspection until the Mortgage Offer is issued. If the 90 day timeframe expires before we receive the Mortgage Offer, your client will need to arrange a replacement Home Report (also known as a refreshed report). We won’t be able to do this.
When your client receives the new Home Report, they should email Panel.Maintenance@nationwide.co.uk and provide the date of the new Home Report (also known as a refreshed report) and check that we have a copy of the up to date transcript. We don’t offer a free Mortgage Valuation report  in this instance.
Please see the Valuations section for more information.

### Missives

Missives covers the exchange of correspondence between solicitors and includes a formal offer to purchase or sell and an acceptance of that offer. Property transactions in Scotland become legally binding for all parties upon ‘conclusion of Missives’ also known as ‘concluding the bargain’.

### Golden Share

A golden share element is a share that gives the shareholder veto power over changes to details held in the contract.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Interest only

Information:
Available to new purchase and remortgage customers only.
We’ve launched the option to choose Interest Only (IO) or part and part repayment basis across our new purchase and remortgage product range*.
If your client would like to temporarily change to interest only payments, please visit nationwide.co.uk (opens in a new window)
See our interest only criteria below to ensure your client is eligible before submitting an application on NFI Online.

## Eligibility

The following eligibility criteria will apply for our interest only new purchases, remortgages and part and part lending:
- maximum 75% loan to value (LTV)
- minimum income criteria of £75,000 for sole applicants, £100,000 for joint applicants**. We base minimum income on primary basic income only.
- minimum equity varies by region***. We'll base this on the region selected on the ‘Loan Requirements’ page on NFI Online. To check which region the property is situated in you can use the House Price calculator (opens in a new window). Minimum equity levels:
- a. £300,000 for Greater London/Outer Metropolitan
- b. £250,000 for Outer South East
- c. £200,000 for all other UK regions
- a. £300,000 for Greater London/Outer Metropolitan
- b. £250,000 for Outer South East
- c. £200,000 for all other UK regions
- maximum term of 25 years (or retirement if sooner )
- sale of main residence as repayment strategy
- You can’t use interest only in conjunction with any other scheme (e.g. Shared Ownership, Genuine Bargain Price, Forces Help to Buy, Right to Buy and Help to Buy)
- minimum lease term of 70 years at application
- maximum loan amount of £5 million
- First time buyers are not eligible for interest only purchase applications.
- Interest only isn't available where the security isn't the main residence e.g. it's not acceptable for an applicant to remortgage a holiday home.
We assess cases on a capital and interest basis. Your client won’t be eligible if:
- they declare that they have a secured loan, but they’re not settling it
- a secured loan has been found at the Bureau but isn’t declared
- a secured loan has been declared, but we find a higher monthly payment at the Bureau
- they're retired, or the term will go into retirement.

### To apply for an interest only new purchase or remortgage

Your client will need to sign our ‘Sale of residence customer declaration form’. They then need to attach it to the case in NFI Online before we can issue any mortgage offer. The declaration confirms that your client understands the requirement to sell their property to repay the outstanding balance at term expiry.
Download our declaration form
Step 1
On the ‘Create Case’ screen, select ‘Remortgage’ or 'New purchase' as the Application type.
Step 2
Then on the ‘Loan Requirements’ screen, select ‘Interest Only (New Borrowing)’.
For new purchase applications, selecting ‘interest only (new borrowing)’ will remove the ability to answer 'yes' to porting existing accounts on the existing mortgages screen.
If you decide that you would like to port the existing mortgages and take the additional borrowing on a capital and interest basis instead, you'll need to proceed with interest only (new borrowing). You can do this by going back to the loan requirements screen and unselecting the ‘interest only (new borrowing)’ option to unlock the ‘would the applicant(s) like to port any of these mortgage accounts’ question.
Step 3
Under Product selection, you can select either ‘Interest Only’ or ‘Part and Part’ under ‘Repayment basis’.
Step 4
Repayment Plan Details will be displayed within the ‘FMA’.  This will be read only and will be defaulted to ‘Sale of main residence’ as the ‘Repayment plan type’. The ‘Amount’ will be defaulted to the value entered as the ‘Loan Amount’ on the ‘Loan Requirements’ screen or if Part and Part this will be defaulted to the amount chosen for Interest Only. A warning message will be displayed if confirmation hasn’t been given.
Step 5
A proof requirement will be displayed on the DIP results screen. This is for the customer declaration which needs to be signed.
* If you wish to port any existing mortgages in a purchase application, additional borrowing must be on a capital and interest (Repayment) basis only. Interest only new borrowing is only available to non-porting purchase applications. If your client wishes to purchase with an element of interest only they'll need to choose a new product and pay any ERC's applicable on the existing product. If they currently have an existing Interest Only product and are looking to increase their borrowing on interest only, and wish to port with a top up on interest only, please speak to your BDM .
** The minimum income criteria will determine if your clients are eligible for our interest only product and the assessment is made using their primary basic source of income.
*** Minimum equity will be applied automatically at the Decision in Principle (DiP) stage. After the valuation, if there’s any impact on the minimum equity requirement it could mean that your client is no longer eligible for this proposition.

# How to submit a case

Information:
You can't submit your own application via NFI Online, however your application can be submitted by another intermediary.
You can submit without advice via Nationwide.co.uk (opens in a new window) or you can call 0345 730 20 10 to arrange an appointment with a Mortgage Adviser.
You can submit all applications via NFI Online.
For purchase applications
Where your client has, or will have on completion, only one mortgaged property, standard LTV limits will apply. Maximum 85% LTV will continue to apply if the client will own two or more mortgaged properties on completion. You must key these as a Second Property application, even if the property being purchased will be your client’s main residence.
For Armed Forces purchase applications
This includes applications where armed forces personnel don't have a UK address and are looking to include a BFPO postcode. Where your client can't provide UK address history, you can key the Ministry of Defence BFPO postcode (opens in a new window) that corresponds to their barracks.

## On this page we cover:

- Amending a submitted case
- Cancelling a submitted case
- Change of property process
- Paper based applications and paper DIP process
- What happens in the event of a rate change?
- Intermediary application exceptions

## Amending a submitted case

For remortgage, new purchase and further advance applications, you can amend the following information for applications already submitted through the 'Amend case' option on NFI Online:
Further advance applications: Loan amount The reason for additional borrowing Mortgage term Product*
Remortgage and new purchase applications: Purchase price Loan amount Deposit details Product* Mortgage term Bank Details Porting loan selection(s) The reason for additional borrowing on a remortgage application Whether you're Porting or not (Existing Customer New Purchase only)
- Loan amount
- The reason for additional borrowing
- Mortgage term
- Product*
- Purchase price
- Loan amount
- Deposit details
- Product*
- Mortgage term
- Bank Details
- Porting loan selection(s)
- The reason for additional borrowing on a remortgage application
- Whether you're Porting or not (Existing Customer New Purchase only)
*If the product fee has been paid upfront, this can't be changed to a no fee product or to a product where the fee is added to the loan. If you need to change this, you'll need to submit a new application.
By amending one part of a case, you may be required to revisit another if the amendment has a material impact. Some amendments may trigger the system to process a new decision in principle. This may result in an additional footprint on your client(s) credit files, new proofs requested, new valuation requirement and a new product.
We'll pause all processing if the case status is on ‘Amend Case’.
There are reasons that may prevent you from amending a case within the 'amend case' option. Some of these reasons may be:
- The case has not been submitted
- The mortgage offer has expired
- Another user is editing the case
- The Certificate Of Title (COT) has been received
- The Solicitor Confirmation Form (SCF) has been received
Please make sure once you have made the required amendments, that you resubmit the case. This way the case status is no longer set to ‘Amend Case’, and will ensure processing of the application resumes.
For post submission case amendments that can’t be done using 'Amend Case', please call us on 0345 730 20 11 from 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday to make a material change to your application by choosing option 4, then option 1 and then option 2.
Please complete a Material Change Form and attach to the application via NFI Online, if you're having difficulties.

## Cancelling a submitted case

If your application is a new purchase or remortgage, you can cancel the case through NFI Online. Once you're on 'Case Home', Click 'Amend Case' and follow the on screen guidance.
If your case is not a new purchase or remortgage, and you wish to cancel the application, please contact us .
How long it takes to get a refund
It may take up to 72 hours after the case shows as cancelled in NFI Online to show against your client’s account. It can be up to a total of 14 days for your client to receive the refund.

## Change of property process

To replace details of one property with another during the application process, you'll need to cancel your client's original case and submit a new application. The new application will require a new product reserved from the rates available at the time of re-application.
. It can take up to ten days for the request to be sent to the credit agencies, who will in turn take varying times to update their own records.
Please note when re-entering your client's details at the 'Create Case' stage, NFI Online will pick up that you've keyed a previous case for this client. If you select 'Add to Case', some details for this client will copy onto the new case, saving you time.

## Paper based applications and paper Decision in principle (Dip) process

You can email us outstanding case information for paper based applications, and send requests for paper DIPs, to the following:
- Case information NACMPOSUpdates@nationwide.co.uk
- MSO rekeys MSO.Rekeys@nationwide.co.uk
- Paper DIP requests exceptions.manualapplications@nationwide.co.uk
We don't process DIP applications received after 3pm until the next business day. Please ensure you provide a ticket number for all applications, or we'll reject the application.
To submit a paper application, you'll need to contact our technical support team to obtain a ticket reference number.
To adhere to PCI-DSS requirements, you must not submit card payment authorisations via email.
You should post paper applications and supporting information to:
Nationwide Building Society (IPA) Northampton Service Centre Kings Park Road Moulton Park Northampton NN3 6NW
- You will have reserved a product with no product fee on receipt of the application form and a cheque or card payment authorisation for the non-refundable booking fee (if applicable). You must indicate on the application form that a 'no fee' product has been chosen.
- You will have reserved a product with a product fee on receipt of the application form and a cheque or card payment authorisation for the non-refundable booking fee and the product fee (if applicable).
- You will have reserved a product where the product fee has been added to the loan on receipt of the application form and a cheque or card payment authorisation for the non-refundable booking fee (if applicable). The application form must indicate that the product fee should be added to the loan.
- We'll return applications received without a cheque or card payment authorisation for the non-refundable booking fee (if applicable). No product will be reserved.
- We'll log every application received which has critical data omitted which prevents us performing a credit score. You will receive a telephone call to try and obtain the missing information. If we can't obtain the information instantly, we'll notify you that we will be returning the application that day with a covering note confirming the reason why.
Click here to download any paper application forms required

## What happens in the event of a rate change?

All paper applications can be emailed to exceptions.manualapplications@nationwide.co.uk to secure a rate. We'll take fee payments separately over the telephone.
You will not have secured the rate if key application information is outstanding. This will prevent the staff progressing the case to product reservation.
We'll honour all paper applications post marked with the date we notified the rate withdrawal. You must make sure you have completed the application in full, with a valid booking fee, if applicable, enclosed.

## Intermediary application exceptions

Intermediaries can't complete a transfer of equity application. In these circumstances, your client should be directed to call 03457 30 20 10 to arrange an appointment with a Mortgage Adviser.

### Switcher dates (earliest date to apply for a rate switch / product transfer)

Rate switches always take effect from the 1st of the month. Switcher applications must be submitted and accepted by the last submission or acceptance date. After this time, the new deal won't apply until the 1st of the following month.

For fixed or tracker products with an ERC, the rate switch can be applied for up to four months ahead of the current product end date. The earliest the switch can take place is the first month of the three months ERC free waiver period. If your client has a tracker product with no ERC, it can be switched to a fixed rate at any time. If your client is on a BMR or SMR product, it can be switched at any time.

Rate switch dates table (source: https://www.nationwide-intermediary.co.uk/products/rate-switch ):
Current product end date | Earliest date to see rates / apply | Dates the new product can start | Last submission or acceptance date
31 December 2025 | 1 September 2025 | 1 October 2025, 1 November 2025, 1 December 2025, 1 January 2026 | 26 December 2025

Your client will be sent a 'Product Maturity' letter sixteen weeks and four weeks before their product ends. Product end dates can be found on the client's latest mortgage offer, mortgage statement or the product maturity letters.

You can cancel a rate switch on or before the 20th of the month before it's due to start. Requests to cancel rate switches after this will not be accepted.

## Additional fees and charges

A Mortgage Illustration will be produced using Nationwide standard valuation fee structure.
In the mortgage application, you must disclose any fees you charge in the Mortgage Illustration. This is so we can disclose them in the offer document.
In Section 2 of the Mortgage Illustration, you can find details of the fees that we pay you. This includes procuration fees and inducements. If you produce a Mortgage Illustration from NFI Online, we’ll disclose within this section the gross procuration fee and details of the recipient(s). This may not be the amount of money that you receive from your company/firm. We’ll calculate the value of any inducement you, your company and any network/club has received.
Nationwide's definition of an inducement includes for example gifts, lunches and valuations.
In Section 4 of the Mortgage Illustration, you can find details of the fees the client is required to pay to the lender and yourself. This includes any applicable valuation, booking and reservation fees that Nationwide charges.
We produce Mortgage Illustration calculations on the product chosen on the day and the information supplied.


Speak to one of our experienced Business Development Advisers if you need any support.

#### Adobe Reader

You can produce a Mortgage Illustration in PDF format. You’ll need Acrobat Reader version 6 or higher.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DIP refer cases

Once you’ve submitted a Decision in Principle, if the decision is 'Refer', you should STOP and wait for a Subjective Accept . At this stage, your case hasn’t been underwritten

## Submitting a Full Mortgage Application (FMA)

Once you’ve received a Subjective Accept, you can proceed and submit the FMA . If you continue to FMA before receiving a Subjective Accept, the valuation won’t be instructed until the case has been fully assessed and is deemed acceptable by our underwriters. This will mean your case will be delayed.
If you’ve received a Subjective Accept, and you need to make any changes to the initial DIP, this could change the application back to 'Refer'.

## Underwriting cases

Your case will only be underwritten once you’ve submitted the FMA .
We need to underwrite some higher risk cases in more detail. For example, we may look at the ‘Year to Date’ figures when considering Bonus, Overtime and Commission.

## Rate changes

In NFI Online, you can reserve a product for 90 days and, even if rates change in this time, we’ll honour the rate that you reserved.

## Editing names and address history

If a DIP decision hasn’t been obtained, you can revisit the DIP section and amend the property details.
Once a DIP has been scored you'll be unable to amend the applicant's name, or their current and previous address history. Please contact Mortgage New Business on 0345 730 20 11 for further guidance.
Some decline decisions will mean that a case can't be edited. If you're still having trouble editing the case, contact one of our experienced advisers on .

## Expired DIPs or declines

When the DIP is declined due to affordability or criteria, you can appeal by getting in touch with your BDM . If you need to appeal a decline that’s been submitted to FMA, please call our Mortgage New Business team .
If the DIP decision is ‘Decline’ due to affordability or criteria , you can change the original data to reprocess and therefore receive a new decision. For more details, read our keying Guide .
For an existing DIP that has expired, you'll have to start again and submit a new DIP, which will leave a new soft footprint on your client's credit record.
When a DIP is declined due to the property, you can appeal the decision by completing the DIP Property Decline Appeal Form .

### Saving you time

If your case is a DIP refer, please wait for a Subjective Accept before submitting the case to FMA and ensure the initial DIP data is keyed accurately. Please also upload all requested documents when you submit the case to FMA, as this will help to avoid any unnecessary delays during the application process.
Our service levels are updated daily so please keep an eye on these. Please don’t contact us within these time frames, we’re working hard to respond to you as soon as we can.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Nationwide’s mortgage API

Information:
We're continuing to make improvements to our API, so you can now submit even more application types through Iress .
We’re always looking for ways to help brokers place business simply and efficiently, which is why our mortgage Application Programming Interface (API) allows you to create Remortgage and New Purchase Decision in Principles (DIPs) in third party platforms, which we'll continue to improve.
Tip:
Our API makes it up to 15 minutes quicker to get a DIP and helps to reduce keying errors.

## How to use Nationwide's API

All you need to do is enter the customer data into your CRM platform and, where relevant, it will be transferred to the third-party platform. This means you don’t need to duplicate all the information.
You can get DIP Certificates for New Purchase applications within third-party platforms. Once you've got your API DIP, the third-party platform will provide a case reference and a link to NFI Online. You will need to follow this link to pre-populate data into NFI Online and use the case reference to find the case. Proceed through DIP to get the decision and then continue to Full Mortgage Application (FMA). The platforms don't currently accept FMAs, so you can submit these via NFI Online (opens in a new window). If the DIP result is 'Refer', you’ll need to send it to NFI Online and wait until it's accepted to progress.

### Third party platform support and information

## Nationwide supports your clients

Unlike the banks, Nationwide is owned by members, not shareholders. Our members include mortgage customers alongside those who bank and save. Your client will be part of a mutual building society who put their members’ needs before profits. This allows us to give the greatest focus to things that matter:
Customer satisfaction. Nationwide have been rated the UK's best high street banking provider for customer satisfaction in the building society and banking sector.*
Rewarding members. Not shareholders. We want to reward members who choose to have their main current account alongside their qualifying mortgage or savings. That's why in 2023, the Fairer Share Payment was introduced. And, why a payment was made again in 2024.
Committed to branches. We recognise that people may want to talk to someone face to face, and that's where our branches could make all the difference. We have over 600 branches across the UK and we have promised to keep them open until at least the start of 2028.**

## Help at times of need

Nationwide believes in fairer banking for all. This means protecting members and their money at every touch point and in every channel. If your client has turned to you at their time of need, we're here. Our experts are ready; face to face, online and over the phone.

## Fraud

If a client is a victim of fraud, help is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Fraud and security

## Vulnerability

We want to ensure the service your clients receive from us supports their needs.

## Bereavement

We will support you and your clients with key contacts and support through this difficult time.

## Payments

# Client support needs

Looking after our customers is important to us. We want to ensure it's easy for your clients to get the support they need to access our products and services. Sharing your clients' support needs will not affect our decision to lend.

## How you can help your clients' with their support needs

A support need is anything that will help your client get the most out of their interactions with us. We want your clients to be able to access our products and services without barriers. So, where possible, we will adjust certain processes or how we communicate with them.
For example, it may be helpful for your client to get letters with larger print. Or they need people to speak slowly and clearly, so they are better able to understand information.
Tell us about your clients' support needs by completing and emailing the following form to vulnerable.customers@nationwide.co.uk . You can do this at any point after submitting an application.
Share your clients' support needs
Before you share your clients' support needs with us, please ensure you have asked your client for permission and have their consent to record their support needs with us. You also need to ensure they understand how we will use their information .
Information:

## How clients' can tell us about their support needs

The benefits of this are:
- They won't have to repeat themselves to other organisations
- They control which organisations know about their support needs
- They will automatically receive the support they need
- Their personal data is safe and secure
Existing clients can tell us about their support needs .

## What is vulnerability?

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) defines a vulnerable customer as someone who "due to their personal circumstances, is especially susceptible to harm, particularly when a firm is not acting with appropriate levels of care."
This means a client could be vulnerable if they are in a situation that is making it difficult for them to manage their finances. Examples could include a life event such as bereavement or job loss. Or a mental or physical illness such as anxiety or cancer. Vulnerability can take many forms and below are further examples.
- Physical disability
- Severe or long term illness
- Hearing or visual impairment
- Mental health condition or disability
- Addiction
- Low mental capacity or cognitive disability
- Retirement
- Bereavement
- Job loss
- Relationship breakdown
- Domestic abuse
- Caring responsibilities
- Inadequate or erratic income
- Over indebtedness
- Low savings
- Low emotional resilience
- Lack of support or structure
- Low knowledge or confidence in managing finances
- Poor literacy or numeracy skills
- Poor English language skills
- Poor or non existent digital skills
- Learning impairments
- No or low access to help or support

## What is a support need?

A support need is something a client has asked us to do to make sure they can access our products and services without barriers. For example, it may be helpful for them to get letters with larger print. Or perhaps they just need people to speak slowly and clearly, so they are better able to understand information.

## Vulnerability toolkit

Here are some tools to help identify if your client has support needs. And how to talk to your clients about them.
I – Impact What happens? What is the problem?
D – Duration How long has it been going on for?
E – Experience Has it happened before? Could it happen again?
A – Assistance Does the client have any help or need any help?
Think of this as part of your solution. It’s your IDEA for how to give the client assistance.
B - Behaviour and talk Look out for or monitor a clients’ behaviour for signs that they are experiencing difficulties with understanding and decision making
R – Remembering Is the client experiencing any problems with their memory or recall? For example, are they asking you to repeat what you are saying
U – Understanding Does the client grasp or understand the information given to them? For example, are they looking confused?
C – Communicating Can the client share and communicate their thoughts, questions and decisions about what they want to do?
E - Evaluating Can the client weigh up the different options open to them?
The TEXAS protocol below, should be used to ensure the client is aware what information we are gathering and how we use it.
T – Thank the client for giving you the information e.g. “Thank you for telling me about your situation, it will help us to help you”
E – Explain how the information will be used. Nationwide will use this information to personalise the service offered to clients where possible
X – eXplicit consent should be obtained from the client to use information in this way
A – Ask questions to establish key information, this will help you understand the situation better. For example: “How does your situation affect your ability to communicate with us?”
S – Signpost them to the most appropriate internal/external help resources e.g. a free debt-advice agency or the NHS111 line for health problems.

### How do I know if recording support needs will help in the future?

Here are some things to consider to assess whether or not to record your client’s support needs:
- How do the client’s circumstances affect their ability to manage their money?
- Do you think the type of help and support they need is a one off request / short term or is it likely to last longer?
- Are there any barriers that we could remove to make it easier for the client now?
- Will a support needs alert ensure a better or more consistent experience for the client?

# Payments

This page includes information on first payments, overpayments and payment difficulties.
- How we'll calculate interest on your clients first payment
- Overpayments
- Overpayment reserve
- Borrow back
- Acceptable proof of payment history
- Repayment Methods
- Payment holidays
- Payment difficulties
- Historic mortgages (Cheshire/Derbyshire/Dunfermline/Portman)

## How we'll calculate interest on your clients first payment

Once your clients have completed their application, they’ll receive a First Payment Notice in writing within 7 working days. This is to inform them of their first mortgage payment and when we’ll take payment from their account.
Your clients' first payment can be higher than their normal monthly payment. It’ll include interest from the date we released the funds to the end of that month. Plus their normal monthly payment for the following month.
For example if your client moves in on the 12 May, their first mortgage payment in June will include interest for 12-31 May. As well as the standard mortgage payment for June.

### Overpayments

Overpayments instantly reduces the capital balance and builds an overpayment reserve. Your client will have a 10% annual overpayment allowance , so they can save money by making overpayments of up to 10% a year. Early Repayment Charges (ERCs) will apply if your client overpays by more than 10% a year during the deal period.  They can benefit even more as we base your client's overpayment allowance on the original loan amount and not the reducing balance.
Information:
Below is an example of a new purchase or remortgage overpayment
- Product Reservation Date - 29 May 2025
- Loan Amount - £100,000
- Overpayment Allowance - 10% of Loan Amount is £10,000
- Mortgage Completion Date – 02 July 2025
- Allowance of £10,000 reset at next anniversary date until the end of the benefit period – 01 August 2026

#### Criteria

Our Base Mortgage Rate (BMR)/Standard Mortgage Rate (SMR) allows unlimited payments for existing customers reaching the end of their deal period. This means your client can overpay by as much as they like, when they like.
Products reserved on or after 29 May 2013 :
- If your client overpays by more than their overpayment allowance each year, an ERC will be payable on the amount paid in excess of the overpayment allowance.
- When a new switch occurs, the overpayment allowance is reset. The new yearly cycle will start from the new switch date.
- The annual overpayment allowance is only applicable whilst in the deal period of our fixed and tracker rate mortgages.
- Tracker rate mortgages have no ERCs, so your clients can make unlimited overpayments without incurring a charge. This applies even if they're switching a tracker product to a fixed rate product.
- You can find the original loan amount advance in the original Mortgage Illustration/Offer
- Percentage allowance is a calculation of the original loan amount minus any admin fees.
Products reserved before 29 May 2013:
- Your client will remain on the £500 per month overpayment allowance. Any ERCs incurred will apply to the entire overpayment amount.
Your client can access more information about overpayments like payment details from the customer website (opens in a new window) .

### Overpayment reserve

If your client(s) make mortgage payments exceeding the contracted monthly amounts, these overpayments will form an 'overpayment reserve'.
If your client has an overpayment reserve, their overall mortgage balance when calculating their loan to value (LTV) may include an overpayment reserve. This won't apply in rate switch applications.
Rate switch applications
When keying, the current mortgage balance will appear on the screen. Your client can then choose to (with prior permission from Nationwide) utilise the 'overpayment reserve' to lower future monthly mortgage payments. We'll only use the outstanding balance to calculate the LTV. For example, if the clients have overpaid £20k into an overpayment reserve, their current mortgage balance is £150k and the property is valued at £200k, so the LTV would be 75%.
Additional borrowing (further advance) applications
We'll include the overpayment reserve when calculating their LTV, which may impact the application. If you would like to remove the overpayment reserve, please complete the overpayment reserve removal form or call us on 0345 730 20 11 . If the overpayment reserve is not impacting the available products, your client may choose to keep the overpayment reserve in place for flexibility of payments in the future.
Borrow back
If your client(s) took out their mortgage product deal with Nationwide before 30 April 2009 , they'll move/have moved to our BMR at the end of their deal. Your client will have access to borrow back and payment holiday facilities. The BMR is guaranteed to be no more than 2% above the Bank of England base rate. If your client chooses to switch to a new mortgage product, they'll no longer have access to the BMR or its facilities and will revert to our SMR which has no upper limit or cap.
If your client's mortgage product was taken out with Nationwide between 30 April 2009 and 4 March 2010 , they may have the borrow back facility to quickly access their overpayment as a lump sum. Before completing an overpayment reserve removal form, please make sure your client is aware that by removing the existing overpayment reserve, they'll not be able to utilise it for future underpayments or borrow back.
If your client(s) took their mortgage out with Nationwide on or after 4 March 2010 , they'll move/have moved to our SMR at the end of their deal. Your client will not have access to borrow back and payment holiday facilities.

### Acceptable proof of payment history

Applicants must not have exceeded 3 months' arrears in the last 3 years.
Evidence of Mortgage payment history using:
- The last annual mortgage statement (covering 12 months' payments)
- Where a mortgage statement covers less than 6 months payments and is over 6 months old, we require the last 3 months bank statements
- If you don't have the above, we'll require an existing lender's reference
Tenancy payment history
We do not require you to verify past payment history for any applicant who is currently renting. Or for an applicant that has been renting over the last twelve months.

### Repayment Methods

Capital and interest: All members
Interest only/part and part: New purchase or remortgage members
Existing interest only members moving home: Read more on our existing Nationwide borrowers page .
All members
Capital and interest (repayment) mortgages. Available for all borrower types.

### Payment holidays

Your client may be able to take a payment holiday if they took their mortgage out prior to 4 March 2010. They may apply to take a payment holiday (between 1 and 12 months), and they must have a mortgage that is less than 80% of the value of their home at the end of the payment holiday.
More information for your client, including how to apply, is available on our customer website (opens in a new window).

### Payment difficulties

If your client is experiencing difficulties in meeting their mortgage repayments then a payment holiday may not be appropriate.
Please ask them to contact us to discuss the options available to them by visiting our customer website (opens in a new window) or by calling us on 0800 464 30 40. Terms and conditions apply.

### Cheshire mortgage

If your client(s) took out their mortgage product deal with Cheshire before 15 June 2009, they'll move/have moved to our BMR at the end of their deal. If your client(s) took out their mortgage product deal with Cheshire on or after 15 June 2009, they'll move/have moved to our SMR at the end of their deal. On both rates your client will have the ability to borrow back any overpayments they have made. If your client chooses to switch to a new mortgage product, they'll no longer have access to these facilities.

### Derbyshire mortgage

If your client(s) took out their mortgage product deal with Derbyshire on or after 31 May 2009, they'll move to our SMR when their deal ends. Your client will not have access to borrow back and payment holiday facilities.

### Dunfermline mortgage

## Purchase, remortgage, additional borrowing (further advance) and porting application procuration fees

We pay a gross procuration fee of 0.20% for new rate switch applications. The fee will appear on the Mortgage Illustration/Offer, and you'll receive payment via your usual mortgage club or network.

## Creating a DIP and keying information

If you want to create a Mortgage Illustration before the DIP in NFI Online, you can enter the data into the DIP process. This will save you having to key the data again. You'll be unable to produce a Mortgage Illustration prior to completing a DIP for additional borrowing (further advance) applications. You don’t have to create a Mortgage Illustration before a DIP.
You can get a DIP decision for your client even if your client hasn’t found a property yet. This won’t include a decision on the property. You’ll need to enter the security details before you can proceed to Full Mortgage Application.
As long as a DIP decision hasn’t been obtained, you can revisit the DIP section and amend the property details. Where a DIP decision has been received, and you’d like to change your clients address, you'll have to complete a new application.
It’s important to ensure that the information you’ve keyed is accurate. If anything’s incorrect, we'll send an underwriting request to make changes. This will delay your decision.
Once the DIP has been scored, you won’t be able to amend the current and previous address history, or applicant’s name. In this case, please contact us for further guidance.

## DIP appeals after a decline

Please contact the following teams if you would like to appeal your decline decision.
- Where your case has been declined due to affordability or criteria - contact your BDM .
- DIP declined due to the property - complete the DIP Property Decline Appeal Form
- The case has been submitted to FMA and the DIP has been declined - contact us .

## DIP case referred

If you get a message saying your case has been referred this means the case needs more investigation. An underwriter will then review the case. To find the latest time frames, check our current service levels .
Your case may get referred for a number of reasons, such as:
- we might not be able to verify details for an existing customer or
- the applicant’s credit history may not be satisfactory etc.
Please don't attach any documents at this stage as this may delay the decision.
You can still reserve a product even if your case has been referred. However, be aware you could lose any fees paid if the case can’t proceed. For more details, see our Fees and charges page .

# Working together to prevent mortgage fraud


## Spotting potential mortgage fraud


### Who to keep an eye out for

People don't always choose to commit fraud. Mortgage fraud can be committed by genuine but desperate people who don't realise they are committing fraud, or the implications of what they are doing.
They are often driven to secure a mortgage on a property after facing pressure from their family and they may do this by exaggerating their income. As many as 1 in 6 adults will exaggerate their income to secure a mortgage.**
There are professionals who commit mortgage fraud for the sole purpose of financial gain. They are experienced and often linked to organised criminal groups. They will have a deep understanding of the industry and how to avoid controls.

### What to look out for when reviewing documents and information

Payslips - when you are collecting your clients' payslips, keep an eye out for:
- Tax - correct tax code, regular payment of tax and correct tax calculations.
- Rounding - rounded numbers are extremely rare on genuine payslips.
- Benefits - check that additional benefits match the wage and job status.
- Format - check the format matches the type or size of the employer.
Staged income - when you are checking your clients' income look out for staged income. Staged income is where applicants create fake income streams and regular payments throughout the application process, which end after completion. Be aware of:
- Applicants who are only employed for a short time before the mortgage application.
- Salary credits paid by 'Faster Payment' instead of BACS.
- Changes in job types that appear out of line with previous roles.
- A recent second job where income is needed to support the application.
- Employers who are small or difficult to trace, or are a family member.
Important:

## Protecting against mortgage fraud

There are also steps you can take to help us protect against mortgage fraud:
- Please report any suspicions as soon as possible. Please email tellsid@nationwide.co.uk or get in touch with your Business Development Manager, and we'll do everything we can to investigate.
- Ensure the clients details you are entering into our systems are accurate (mobile, email and address) and do not enter your own details.
- If you are working with a new client, check they are who they say they are. Use Companies House, LinkedIn or other social media channels.
*Fraud costs the UK economy £193 billion a year, equating to more than £6,000 lost per second every day - Experian UK .
** Cifas research reveals 1 in 6 UK adults have exaggerated earnings to secure a mortgage.
