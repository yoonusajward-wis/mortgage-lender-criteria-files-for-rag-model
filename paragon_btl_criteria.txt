Where aggregate lending with Paragon Banking Group is in excess of £2,000,000 (including any fees added to the loans), this will be subject to additional underwriting and will require:

* A portfolio review meeting with a senior underwriter
* Cash flow forecast*
* Business plan*
* Net worth statement*

*Electronic copies are available on our website www.paragonbank.co.uk/btbdocuments/Intermediary

### Loan Purpose

We will consider applications for either the purchase or remortgage of buy-to-let properties and further advances.

We will only consider capital raising for the purpose of owning and renting residential property.

For remortgage / capital raising applications, properties must be owned in the name of all applicants.

### Purchase Application

The loan amount will be calculated using the lower of the purchase price or the current valuation.

All deposit funds must originate from the UK, and we may need proof of the source of these funds.

Where the whole balance of the purchase price is not coming from the applicants' own funds, full details will be required.

### Remortgage Application

We will consider remortgage applications where the applicant has been the registered proprietor for less than six months. However, the loan amount will be based upon the lower of the purchase price or current valuation.

We may consider using the current valuation where it can be demonstrated that since the date of purchase, significant improvement works which have enhanced the property value have been carried out. In these instances, a schedule of works and evidence of expenditure will be required.

The property must be registered at the Land Registry (or in Scotland, Registers of Scotland) as owned by the applicant(s), at the date of completion.

### Consumer Buy-to-Let

We will accept applications that qualify as consumer buy-to-let mortgage contracts, if the appropriate criteria is being met.

More information about consumer buy-to-let can be found on our website at www.paragonbank.co.uk/personal/mortgages/buy-to-let/consumer-buy-to-let.

### Mortgage Term

* Minimum: 5 years
* Maximum: 35 years

The mortgage term for a further advance must match the remaining term of the existing mortgage.

### Repayment Methods

Interest only, capital and interest repayment, and part interest only and part capital repayment loans are available.

### Property Investment Clubs and Syndicates

We will not accept applications where the property is being purchased or refinanced through, or where the applicant is in any way connected to, a property investment club or syndicate.

---

## Income / Affordability

We will assess the affordability of a mortgage based on the expected monthly income generated from letting the property to a tenant. The actual income generated may be different and can be influenced over time by changes within the rental market.

The applicant(s) will remain responsible for meeting the costs of the mortgage and the additional costs associated with letting the property for the duration of the mortgage.

### Income

Applicants should have a minimum combined gross annual income of £25,000 per annum.

All income must be evidenced and can include:

* gross employment income
* taxable self-employed income
* occupational or private pension income
* state pension income

However, we understand the specialist nature of a landlords' income structure. So, where a landlord or limited company has four or more properties, and can't meet the £25,000 minimum income, but can demonstrate they have sufficient income to cover their existing expenditure, we will consider and assess these applications on a case-by-case basis.

**For individuals with three or fewer mortgaged buy-to-let properties:**

State benefits, investment income and income derived from Land and Property will not be considered but may be taken into account when calculating the tax band applicable to an applicant.

**For individuals with four or more mortgaged buy-to-let properties, limited companies and applications for Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) or multi-unit blocks:**

State benefits and investment income will not be considered but may be taken into account when calculating the tax band applicable to an applicant.

The useable income figure in respect of Land and Property income will be derived by deducting the total amount of 'residential finance costs' from the 'taxable profit for the year' figure, in line with current tax calculation requirements. For more information about this, please see our **how to calculate usable income for landlords guide.**

### Affordability

Any fees that will be added to the loan will be included in the loan amount used in both the current and future affordability calculations.

All applications will be subject to validation of:

* The income requirements above
* The gross rental income from the property equalling or exceeding the Interest Cover Ratio (ICR), as determined using a combination of the tax band applicable to an applicant's income and the property type. The tax band applicable to the applicant with the highest income will be used.

All calculations will be based on either the current reference rate published on our website and in our product guides, or the product charging rate plus 2%, whichever is the greater. The exception to this is our five year fixed rate products, which will be calculated using either the current five year fixed reference rate published on our website and in our product guides, or the product charging rate, whichever is the greater. Some products may be subject to an individual reference rate, but where this is the case, it will be clearly indicated within the product details.

Future affordability will also be taken into account and may limit the maximum loan amount available. Before submitting an application, please ensure you check how much we may be able to lend your client by using our online calculator, which can be found on our website www.paragonbank.co.uk/intermediary/btl

For further advances, the affordability assessment will take into account both the proposed advance (including fees added to the loan) and the existing loans secured against the property.

**Tax Band and ICR (Interest Cover Ratio) Levels:**

**For single self-contained properties:**
* Basic rate tax payers (20%) and limited companies: 125%
* Higher rate tax payers (40%) and additional rate tax payers (45%): 140%

**For HMOs, multi-unit blocks, and all other property types:**
* Basic rate tax payers (20%) and limited companies: 130%
* Higher rate tax payers (40%) and additional rate tax payers (45%): 145%

We must be satisfied that the applicant(s) can withstand increases in mortgage interest rates, cover rental voids, and afford the mortgage both now and after any fixed or discounted period expires. We may request evidence of contingency funds to support increased mortgage payments and may decline an application if we believe the applicant will not be able to meet mortgage payments should interest rates increase.

The ICR calculation is determined by multiplying the amount of loan by the ICR calculation rate and the ICR tax band percentage, resulting in the minimal rental income required to borrow the requested amount of loan.

## Property

### Minimum Property Valuation

£75,000

### Valuations

We will take a first legal charge and will normally consider most types of traditionally constructed residential property in England, Wales or Scotland.

Further advances will be secured by way of a second charge against the property.

A security assessment and valuation report will be arranged as soon as an application is received. This is to determine the property value, the realistic and sustainable monthly rental income and the suitability of the property for mortgage purposes.

Although we will provide you with a copy of the valuation, this is for mortgage lending purposes only. It is not intended to provide a detailed report on the condition of the property, and if this is required, it should be instructed separately by the applicant to be carried out by a suitably qualified independent surveyor.

Any property we are considering should be lettable in its current condition.

Properties that are likely to have low demand from tenants due to their current condition, location or other factors, including poor maintenance or management of common areas, will not normally be acceptable.

We reserve the right to accept or decline any individual property.

Before completion of the loan, a revaluation will be arranged by us, at the applicant's expense, where the initial inspection is more than four months old.

The property must comply with the current Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) regulation, and have a minimum rating of E, unless there is an applicable exemption. This will be verified by Paragon and the acting solicitor, and we will not be able to lend on any property that is found not to be compliant. We will be unable to consider a further advance application on any property that does not meet the current EPC regulation. It is the responsibility of the applicant(s) to ensure that the property remains compliant with the EPC regulation for the duration of the mortgage term.

### Multi-Unit Property

The applicant must have a minimum two years lettings experience as a landlord.

A single property may be divided into a maximum of 20 units and the following minimum values will apply:

* Up to 10 units, the property value must be greater than or equal to £100,000
* Up to 20 units, the property value must be greater than or equal to £150,000

If more than one unit (house or flat) is held on a single title and each unit is capable of sale separately, although a valuation based on the total value of all units may be used, a discounted reflecting the value as a single purchase will be applied.

We will not consider properties where more than 50% of the units are on long leases.

At our discretion, and where considered appropriate, an investment valuation may be carried out.

Where the property has been purchased in the last 12 months:

* and there has been an uplift in value, it will be subject to a maximum LTV of 70%
* but the property value and lending requirements equate to a like for like transaction, we may consider lending more than 70%, subject to product criteria

Where the property was purchased more than 12 months ago, and there has been a significant recent uplift in valuation, we may still limit the advance to a maximum LTV of 70%.

### House in Multiple Occupation (HMO)

A property is a HMO if at least three tenants live there, forming more than one household, and sharing toilet, bathroom or kitchen facilities.

The applicant must have a minimum two years' lettings experience as a landlord.

The following minimum HMO values will apply:

* Up to 10 rooms - the property value must be greater than or equal to £100,000
* Up to 20 rooms - the property value must be greater than or equal to £150,000

At our discretion, and where considered appropriate, an investment valuation may be carried out.

Where the property has been purchased in the last 12 months:

* and there has been an uplift in value, it will be subject to a maximum LTV of 70%
* but the property value and lending requirements equate to a like for like transaction, we may consider lending more than 70%, subject to product criteria

Where the property was purchased more than 12 months ago, and there has been a significant recent uplift in valuation, we may still limit the advance to a maximum LTV of 70%.

Where a HMO has been subject to alteration, conversion or change of use, the following items will be required:

* a copy of the current HMO licence. If applicable, for property purchases, a copy of the new HMO licence will also be required after completion
* confirmation that the property has planning permission for its current layout and use. Evidence will be required after completion, and this can be:
  * a copy of the planning consent(s) for the current configuration/use
  * permitted development for change from Class C3 to C4 of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) (Amendments) (England) Order 2010
  * assuming no Article 4 Direction Order is in place at the time of the change
  * sui generis (as appropriate)
  * an established use certificate or a certificate of lawfulness of existing use or development

### Investment Valuations

An investment valuation may be carried out where the property is no longer capable of being assessed as a single residential dwelling. This may be either due to the overall level of occupancy, or its subdivision into separate units.

For multi-unit properties (purpose built or converted), an investment valuation will be carried out.

For HMO's, an occupancy level of five or more tenants will normally require an investment valuation.

### All Properties

Where a property has been subject to alteration, conversion or change of use, the following items will need to be forwarded with the deeds:

* evidence that the property has the appropriate building regulations approval
* a copy of the building regulations completion certificate

### Property Exclusions

A property is unacceptable if it is:

* an ex-local authority flat or maisonette
* non-traditional construction such as concrete or timber or where existing or possible structural defects are apparent
* a shared ownership property (currently or previously)
* a converted flat where the applicant occupies a property in the same building
* a freehold flat or maisonette in England and Wales
* subject to unreasonable lease terms, including onerous ground rent amounts, review periods, escalation provisions and event fees
* a leasehold property in Scotland
* designated as defective under any housing legislation
* subject to agricultural or other planning restrictions
* subject to notice of mineral extraction, contaminated land or previous mining subsidence and landfill
* being purchased under the Right to Buy Scheme or Housing Association Scheme
* built within the last ten years without an NHBC certificate or another guarantee acceptable to us
* subject to a pre-emption clause
* located within either ten metres of an electrical sub-station or 100 metres of an overhead high voltage cable or communication mast
* located in Wales and occupied on the basis of a secure contract
* a flat in a building which requires a scheme of remediation to the external wall system

At our discretion, the following types of property may be considered on an individual basis:

* ex-local authority houses
* flats in blocks over 10 storeys high or with more than 100 units
* studio flats, with a minimum of 30 square metres
* new or recently built flats where there is, or is likely to be, a low demand from tenants
* leasehold flats and maisonettes attached to or above commercial premises
* residential let property where there is a commercial element not exceeding 40% of the total floor space of the whole property
* properties with an element of "flying freehold"
* self-build properties
* properties with restrictions relating to sale or occupancy eg Section 106 notice
* properties subject to chancel repairs/liability
* properties subject to issues identified by an environmental search

### Tenure

**Acceptable tenure in England, Wales or Scotland:**
* Freehold/heritable

**Acceptable tenure in England and Wales only:**
* Leasehold, subject to a minimum of 85 years unexpired term at the commencement of the mortgage, and 65 years unexpired term at the end of the mortgage

Ground rent and other event fees must be reasonable at all times during the lease term.

It is acceptable for ground rent escalation to be linked to Retail Price Index (RPI) or a similar index where the review period is 10 years or greater. Reviews every five years are not acceptable. The passing ground rent must be in proportion to the capital value of the property and not materially affect its value.

Unreasonable multipliers of ground rent will not be permitted, for example, doubling every 10 or 15 years. If you are unsure as to whether the terms of a lease are unreasonable, please refer the details to us for consideration.

Please note, possessory title is not normally acceptable.

### Occupancy

Depending on the specific conditions of each loan, the property must be occupied by acceptable tenants (please see the let property section for details). The property may be vacant between lettings for up to 90 days, subject to the terms of the insurance cover being complied with.

### Legal Charges

We require a first legal charge (or in Scotland, standard security) over the property.

We will not accept subsequent charges in favour of any other party, for any purpose, including borrowing from other lending institutions.

For further advances, we require a second legal charge over the property.

---

## Letting Requirements

The landlord is responsible for checking the legal status of a tenant to ensure they have a permanent right to reside in the UK.

**In England, property may either be let:**
* on an assured shorthold tenancy, subject to a minimum term of six months and a maximum of 36 months
* or to a limited company registered in England, Wales or Scotland, or a suitable educational institute for up to three years

In all instances, the limited company, suitable educational institute, local authority or housing association:
* must not occupy or use the property for any business purposes
* must not be an accommodation and support services provider that provides support, services/assistance to the occupiers or engages any third party to provide any such accommodation and support services/assistance to the occupiers

**In Wales, occupation on the basis of a secure contract by any occupier is not permitted. The only basis upon which the property may be let is either:**
* under a standard contract as defined by the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 ('The Act') subject to a minimum term of six months and a maximum of 36 months
* or to a limited company registered in England, Wales or Scotland, or a suitable educational institute for up to three years
* to a local authority or housing association for up to five years

In all instances, where the property is occupied by a private individual or individuals:
* their rights of occupation must not extend beyond the term granted to the acceptable tenant
* they must occupy the property only for the purposes of their main residence without the provision of any support services/assistance from any service provider

In all instances, the limited company, suitable educational institute, local authority or housing association:
* must not occupy or use the property for any business purposes
* must not be an accommodation and support services provider that provides support, services/assistance to the occupiers or engages any third party to provide any such accommodation and support services/assistance to the occupiers

**In Scotland, property may either be let:**
* on a short assured tenancy, subject to a minimum term of six months and a maximum term of 12 months
* or on a private residential tenancy

In all instances, where the property is occupied by a private individual or individuals:
* their rights of occupation must not extend beyond the term granted to the acceptable tenant.
* they must occupy the property only for the purposes of their main residence without the provision of any support services/assistance from any service provider.

For full details please refer to our General and Special conditions booklet on our website www.paragonbank.co.uk/btldocuments/intermediary

Each tenancy agreement must require the rent to be paid at either monthly or quarterly intervals (or in the case of students, termly).

Property shall not in whole or in part be let to or occupied by:

* the applicant, or any member of their family
* the guarantor, or any member of their family
* the vendor of the property, or any member of their family
* any previous owner of the property, or any member of their family
* an employee of the applicant
* an associated subsidiary, or parent company of the applicant

Sale-and-rent-back arrangements are not acceptable.

Holiday lets are not acceptable.

Where a tenancy agreement pre-dates the completion of the loan, then the solicitor acting must ensure that our interests are fully protected, and the property is let in accordance with our criteria.

---

## Solicitors

We will normally instruct the applicant's solicitors/licensed conveyancers to act on behalf of both parties provided:

* the firm has a minimum of four partners each holding current practising certificates/licenses, operates from commercial premises, has been in business for at least three years, and is currently registered with the Law Society/Council for Licensed Conveyancers
* the solicitor/licensed conveyancer acting holds a current practising certificate and is currently registered with the Law Society/Council for Licensed Conveyancers
* the solicitor/licensed conveyancer acting holds Professional Indemnity Insurance cover of £4 million or more where the loan amount being applied for is £2 million or more
* the firm is registered on Lender Exchange, agrees to our terms and conditions, and has been accepted onto our conveyancing panel

Should an applicant choose a firm that is not acceptable to us, they will act solely for the applicant. The applicant will then have to select another firm from our panel to act on our behalf, and any costs incurred from both firms will be the responsibility of the applicant whether or not completion takes place.

In all cases, we reserve the right to instruct alternative solicitors/licensed conveyancers to act solely for us and again, any costs incurred from both firms, will be the responsibility of the applicant(s) whether or not completion takes place.

To see if your solicitor is on our panel of approved firms, please check the Lender Exchange website.

---

## Property Insurance

Index linked buildings insurance will be required to be maintained for the rebuilding cost of the property.

The applicant(s) must make their own insurance arrangements, and we reserve the right to request a copy of the insurance policy. The applicant must contribute towards the cost of contingency insurance taken out by Paragon, to cover any subsequent loss as a result of any inadequacy of the insurance arranged by them.

All properties must be acceptable to insurers on standard terms ie, exclusions or increased excesses must not apply.

For leasehold property, the freeholders may already have adequate cover in force under the terms of the lease.

The solicitor will be required to confirm that the policy meets the minimum requirements of the mortgage contract, is in force at completion and that, wherever possible, our interest has been noted on the policy.

Where a higher reinstatement value for the property is confirmed on a further advance valuation, it will be necessary for the existing buildings insurance cover to be increased accordingly.

---

## Underwriting

### Decision

To evaluate the suitability of an application, we will undertake a detailed assessment of the following:

* the applicant's credit history
* the applicant's credit score
* the applicant's income and employment status
* the overall affordability of the loan
* the loan to value
* the suitability and value of the property
* whether the rental income available is sufficient to support the loan
* the tenant's right to reside

### Final Decision

We reserve the right to determine whether to make an offer and the terms on which the offer is made.

### Verification

We may contact all applicants by telephone to verify information submitted in support of the application.

When assessing the application, we reserve the right to validate any references, or any other documentation received.

Updated references will be required where completion has not taken place within six months.

Our offer of loan will be issued by email. Therefore, we require email addresses for all applicants, solicitor and intermediary.

---

## Refurb-to-Let

Our refurb-to-let product is available for refitting and modernisation works that do not materially change the existing floor area of a property, and where costs do not usually exceed 25% of the current property value.

This does not cover alterations that require planning permission, permitted development rights or building regulations approval and should not involve any major structural works to the property. There should also be no change of use to the property, except between planning use class C3 to C4 (permitted or with consent in place), ie smaller properties up to and including six sharers.

In all instances a proposed schedule of works must be submitted, either with the online application or immediately after. It is important that as much detail as possible is provided, in terms of the proposed works, pricing, timescales and contractors, including a detailed project plan if available and evidence of the funds required to complete the scheduled works. All information will be passed to our surveyor prior to the valuation, which will not be carried out until full details are received.

When the scheduled works are completed, the refurb-to-let loan will then be replaced with a standard buy-to-let mortgage. You can find details of the products available in our buy-to-let product guide.

Both the refurbishment loan and buy-to-let mortgage will be assessed and offered at the same time, which means fee reductions will apply – details of which can be found in our buy-to-let product guide.

### Criteria Exceptions

The standard criteria set out in these guidelines will apply to our refurb-to-let applications, subject to the following exceptions:

**Minimum loan amount:** Purchase/Remortgage: £30,000

**Maximum loan amount:** Purchase / Remortgage: £1,000,000

**Minimum property valuation:** £50,000

**Loan to value (LTV):**

|:--------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| 70% | 75% | 75% | 70% |

Any fees that may be added to the loan are excluded from the LTV calculations.

### Maximum Aggregate Borrowing

A normal total mortgage exposure per borrower of £5,000,000 may be advanced to an applicant on a property portfolio.

### Loan Purpose

We will generally consider applications for either purchase or remortgage of residential investment property.

### Consumer Buy-to-Let

We will not consider refurb-to-let applications that qualify as consumer buy-to-let mortgage contracts.

### Mortgage Term

* Minimum: 1 month
* Maximum: 6 months

### Repayment Methods

Interest only loans with the repayment type of either serviced monthly payments or gross rolled up interest are available.

### Property Valuation

* Minimum property valuation: £50,000

A security assessment and valuation report will be arranged to determine the property value, in its present condition at the time of submission.

A fully completed schedule of works will be required prior to valuation and should be accompanied by as much supporting documentation as possible.

An after works capital value will also be provided, and the property will be assessed in respect of the realistic and sustainable monthly rental income. Any properties that are likely to have low demand from tenants due to location or other factors, will not normally be acceptable.

We reserve the right to accept or decline any individual property.

After completion of the refurbishment loan, we reserve the right to arrange at our discretion, a revaluation at our expense, to review the progress of works.

### House in Multiple Occupation (HMO)

A copy of the current licence, if applicable, must be provided evidencing that the property is capable of being let on a multiple occupancy basis having regard to the permitted number of occupants and any attached conditions.

Where the HMO has already been altered/converted or had a change of use, the following MUST be provided before release of funds:

* evidence of planning consent for any alteration/conversion and/or change of use. This may be a permitted development, a formal planning consent or a lawful development certificate
* evidence of building regulations approvals together with a building regulations completion certificate where applicable

Please note, we do not accept indemnity insurance in the absence of the above.

### All Properties

Where a property has been subject to alteration, conversion or change of use, the following items will be required to be forwarded with the deeds, unless the property is a HMO, when copies will be required prior to release of funds:

* a copy of the current HMO licence, if applicable (for property purchases a copy of the new HMO licence will also be required after completion)
* evidence that the property has the benefit of planning permission for its current layout and use. Evidence may be in the form of a copy of the planning consent(s) for the current configuration/use, permitted development for change from Class C3 to C4 of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) (Amendments) (England) Order 2010, assuming no Article 4 Direction Order in place at the time of the change, or sui generis (as appropriate); an established use certificate or a certificate of lawfulness of existing use or development
* Evidence that the property has the benefit of appropriate building regulations approval and a copy of the building regulations completion certificate

### Occupancy

Depending on the specific conditions of each loan, the property may be vacant for the duration of the proposed refurbishment works, subject to the conditions of the insurance cover being complied with.

### Offer of Loan

Both the refurbishment loan and buy-to-let mortgage will be offered at the same time.

The refurbishment offer will lapse if completion does not take place within three calendar months of it being issued.

The buy-to-let mortgage offer is valid for six calendar months from the date it is issued, allowing the refurbishment loan to complete and the works to be carried out. Once the works have been finalised, you can then complete on the buy-to-let mortgage.

### Post-Completion Monitoring

Due to the complex nature and limited timeframe of this borrowing, close contact will be maintained by a bespoke team of underwriters throughout the term.
