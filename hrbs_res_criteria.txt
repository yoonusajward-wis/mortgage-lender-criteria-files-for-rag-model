## Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor (JBSP)

**Source:** https://intermediaries.hrbs.co.uk/criteria/jbsp/

### Overview

Our enhanced Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor (JBSP) mortgage allows **family and friends** to be included on the mortgage application, boosting the amount that can be borrowed. All parties share responsibility for the mortgage, but only the main purchaser is on the property deeds.

**Important Note:** For applications of this nature, the applicant who will not be party to the mortgage deed must receive Independent Legal Advice prior to the completion of the mortgage.

### Key Features

* **Up to four borrowers** on a joint application
* **Non-family members accepted** - We can accept borrowers who are not family members
* **Flexible income calculation** - Affordability based on an income multiple of x4.49 for the two highest earners and x1 for any additional applicants
* **Tailored Term available** - Can add a Tailored Term element to the mortgage, allowing different applicants to share the mortgage over different timescales

### Maximum LTV

| Relationship to Main Applicant | Maximum LTV |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| Parent | 95%* |
| Spouse | 95%* |
| Sister | 95%* |
| Brother | 95%* |
| Non-family members/other joint applicants | 80% (Must be referred to the MRC and be residential home owners.) |

*When products are available.

### Tailored Term

For even greater flexibility, we can add a Tailored Term element to the mortgage, allowing different applicants to share the mortgage over different timescales. This is a major advantage where there is a significant age gap between applicants, because unlike many other lenders we don't restrict all borrowers to a term that's based on the oldest applicant. Instead, we calculate what the youngest applicant can afford over the maximum term, and tailor an older applicant's contribution over a shorter term.

## Green Mortgages

**Source:** https://intermediaries.hrbs.co.uk/criteria/green-mortgages/

### Overview

Our homes account for 30% of the country's total energy use. We are keen to play our part in reducing home energy consumption by offering cost-friendly funding solutions to existing borrowers seeking to improve their EPC rating.

If you're planning to renovate your property or enhance your home's energy efficiency, our green mortgages may be able to support you.

We offer Green Mortgage products to borrowers pledging to use at least 50% of the additional funds for energy efficiency improvements. If your client has plans for their property, you may be eligible for a Green Mortgage.

### Retrogreen Partnership

The Society has partnered with green retrofit specialist **Retrogreen** to help residential and investment property owners understand their property's energy efficiency and consider the steps they might take to improve it, reduce energy consumption, and improve the property's EPC rating.

Integral to the service is the ease with which people can gain an understanding of their property's current energy efficiency and create a plan for improving it.

Supported financially by Hinckley & Rugby, projects can be managed end to end by Retrogreen.
