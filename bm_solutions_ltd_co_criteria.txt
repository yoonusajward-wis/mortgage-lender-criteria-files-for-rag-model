## 4. INCOME

### AFFORDABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY
- Assessment: Affordability is assessed using the anticipated rental income from the property. We'll also assess personal income when making a lending decision, so it's important the directors and shareholders income is keyed accurately as it might affect the decision
- Personal Commitments: When doing this, we expect to see the directors and shareholders can afford their personal commitments, so we can be confident our lending decision is sustainable if the tenant stops paying or the property needs any maintenance or repairs. An application might be declined if our assessment shows there's not enough disposable income to support the borrowing and the directors and shareholders personal commitments
- Rental Cover: In our rental cover calculation, we want the directors and shareholders to have more rent coming in than the normal mortgage payment, so the situations mentioned earlier can be covered
- Tax Liability: We'll also take the additional cost of increased tax liability for directors or shareholders into account
- Financial Picture: We understand personal income might not fully reflect the overall financial picture for the directors and shareholders. They could have other assets and savings, for example. We also know the buy to let might be in a single name, but personal financial commitments could be held jointly with someone else

Some of the information we might need to manually underwrite an application, includes:
- How the directors and shareholders manage their commitments
- How they've built up any reserves, including the deposit
- Whether they have previous experience of buying to let
- The rationale for sole director, where finances are joint
- Business details for self-employed directors and shareholders

### DIRECTORS OR SHAREHOLDERS NOT PAID IN STERLING
- Definition: Foreign currency income is any income other than sterling received by directors or shareholders. Foreign currency income paid into a UK bank account and transferred to sterling is still considered to be foreign currency
- Not Accepted: Foreign currency income won't be accepted for new mortgage or remortgage applications for new and existing directors or shareholders, including porting, transfers of mortgaged property (TOMP), and further advances
- Exceptions: The only exceptions to this are further advance applications for essential repairs to the mortgaged property and product transfers

### CONTRACTORS
- Employed: If your directors or shareholders are classed as employed, they'll need to have been in their current role for at least three months
- Self-Employed: If your directors or shareholders are classed as self-employed, we'll need at least two years' worth of trading figures

Sub-contractors, fixed/short term contracts, and agency workers:
- Consideration: We'll consider applications from these directors and shareholders if they have continuous employment of 12 months or more with six months of the contract remaining, or the directors and shareholders have two years' continuous service in the same type of employment
- Evidence: Evidence of their employment record might be needed

IT and other contractors:
- High Income Contractors: For IT contractors on any income and other contractors whose income is more than £500 per day or £75,000 per annum, whether employed or self-employed, we accept the gross value of the contract as evidence of income
- Requirement: All directors and shareholders must have a current continuous employment of 12 months or more with six months of the contract remaining or two years continuous service in the same type of employment
- Self-Employed Treatment: The directors and shareholders should be treated as self-employed if they have more than one contract, or where they've set up a limited company and employ other contractors

Construction Industry Scheme Contractors (CIS):
- Income Evidence: For these directors and shareholders, they'll need to provide an average of their latest 3 months income
- Self-Employed Treatment: They should be treated as self-employed if they pay their own tax or sub-contract to more than one company

Zero-hours contracts:
- Consideration: Applications from directors and shareholders employed on a zero-hours contract will be considered
- Income Calculation: We'll only take income from the total of the last 12 calendar months into account income
- Verification: Directors and shareholders will have to verify their income

Professional sports people:
- Requirement: Professional sports people will have to confirm they've either been in continuous employment for 12 months or more with six months of the contract remaining, or two years' continuous service as at the date of application in the same type of employment
- Verification: It's essential to verify these directors and shareholders will be able to meet their monthly repayments as they near the end of their career or if their career's ended early because of injury

### INCOME TYPES

### RENTAL INCOME
- Requirement: For employed, self-employed, and retired directors and shareholders, all rental income and finance costs captured in the 'Land and property income' section of the application should match the directors and shareholders tax calculations from HMRC
- Guidance: You can find how to key this in our Hints & tips PDF (3.1MB)

To key a directors or shareholders whose only source of income is from land and property:

- Other Figures: The remaining figures for net profit, turnover, gross profit, current assets, and current liabilities must be input as '£0'. Complete the 'Self-employment details' - including business name and accountant details - and the 'Add employment' section. The land and property profit figures from the tax calculation will then need to be entered into the land and property income section
- Finance Costs: Any finance costs for the latest year will also need to be entered. The finance costs are referenced at the bottom of the tax calculation, as well on the individual's self-assessment tax return, and property income supplement (SA105)
- Verification: For 'Can income be verified?', you must answer 'Yes'

For all remortgages and further advances:
- Current Rental: The current rental amount of the property should be keyed on the application as the current monthly rent paid by the tenant

For a buy to let purchase:
- Anticipated Rent: The current rental amount keyed will be the anticipated monthly rent of the property
- Property Schedule: The gross monthly rent will need to be keyed into the property schedule screen for all buy to let properties owned by any directors and shareholders named on the application
- Verification: A tenancy agreement or letter from the letting agent can be used to verify the rental income keyed in the Property schedule screen

### SECOND JOB
- Consideration: If any director or shareholder has more than one job, we'll consider the following to decide if we can take the secondary income into account:
  * Are the hours/days worked sustainable?
  * Are the roles/skills similar?
  * What's the distance between the jobs and the directors or shareholders home?
  * How long has the directors or shareholders been in both jobs?
  * Is the salary consistent with the type of employment?
- Keying: You should key the highest income as the directors and shareholders main income, and the income from the second job as additional employment

### SELF-EMPLOYED DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS
- Requirement: Self-employed directors and shareholders must have been self-employed for a minimum of 2 years and be able to provide at least 2 years' worth of trading figures
