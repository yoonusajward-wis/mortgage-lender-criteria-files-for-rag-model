## SECTION 2 – Affordability

All applicants are required to pass an income affordability test which includes earned and rental income, credit commitments including residential mortgage payment, existing and applied for BTL mortgage payments, other costs associated with the rental property, essential expenditure and living costs.

If the applicant wishes to take a mortgage beyond their stated retirement age we will require evidence of current income along with retirement income in the form of: the most recent Annual Pensions Statement, or the customer's most recent bank statements showing 2 months pension credits.

If the applicant is within 5 years of their planned retirement age we will use their Pension Income in our credit assessment. Please provide your clients planned retirement age in the Additional Information section of the application form.

We can only lend to portfolio landlords if they are requesting a remortgage with no additional borrowing.

The maximum number of buy to lets the client can have with the bank is 3 or a maximum lending exposure of £1 million. (The lending exposure can increase to £1.5 million when at least one of the properties is located in London and South East area.)

London & South East defined as: Greater London (post codes starting E, EC, N, NW, SE, SW, W, WC, BR, CR, DA, EN, HA, IG, KT, RM, SM, TW, or UB), Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, East Sussex, Hampshire, Isle of Wight, Kent, Oxfordshire, Surrey, West Sussex.


## SECTION 3 – Age

For Interest Only mortgages where downsizing is being used as the repayment vehicle, the maximum age at the end of the mortgage term is the lower of 70 and 364 days or the customer's declared retirement age.

View lending into retirement policy.


## SECTION 4 – Applicants

The maximum number of applicants is 2.


## SECTION 5 – Assignable Contracts

We do not lend on assigned contracts.

This is where a vendor allows the assignment of a purchase contract from the original buyer to a new buyer before completion.


## SECTION 6 – Back To Back Transactions

Back to back transactions (where a property is purchased and immediately sold or where there are multiple transactions in quick succession) are not acceptable. We will not provide mortgage lending where the purchase application transaction forms part of a back to back transaction arrangement.


## SECTION 7 – Background Buy-To-Lets

We will need to see your client's last 3 months' bank statements to evidence the rental income where they have 3 or less buy to let properties.

If your client has 4 or more buy to let properties we will need to see their last 3 years' accounts or their last 3 years' self assessment forms combined with the respective SA302's to evidence the combined rentals received and interest charged for all properties.

We will also require a full list of all properties owned together with addresses, lenders details, mortgages outstanding, monthly mortgage payments and rents received.


## SECTION 8 – Bank Statements

Copies of your client's bank statements are only required in the following instances:
* Contractors: 3 months bank statements are required for the account where the contracting monies are received
* To evidence rental income for any background BTL properties which the applicant(s) own
* To evidence the deposit for any proposed property purchase (latest statement required only in this instance)
* Total loan is above £1m: we will require the clients latest 3 months bank statements
* For self employed customers we may ask for the latest months' business bank statement. We'll let you know if we need it

We will accept online statements if they include:
* The applicant's name
* Account number and sort code


## SECTION 9 – Bonus And Variable Income

For variable pay received annually, six monthly or quarterly, we will use 60% of the 2 year average. If the most recent year is lower, we'll use 60% of that.

For variable pay received monthly or weekly, we will use 60% of the variable pay from the lowest of the most recent two payslips. If the year-to-date figure is lower, we'll use 60% of the variable pay showing in the year-to-date.

Exceptionally, we may be able to use up to 75% of variable income where a 3 year track record of stability is held (2 years if monthly or more regular). This must be agreed with us before applying.

To find out what we need to evidence variable income, check out our packaging requirements.


## SECTION 10 – Capital Raising

Capital raising is permitted as part of a re-mortgage application or against an unencumbered property. The loan purpose must be legal and genuine.

The following restrictions/requirements apply:
* Home Improvements: For requests greater than £50,000 or greater than 20% of the properties current value (whichever is the lowest value) the applicant(s) must provide builder/contractor estimates for completion of the proposed works. For work that requires Planning Permission evidence of planning consent must be provided
* Debt Consolidation: Maximum LTV 80%. For such applications there is no requirement to input the monthly payments as expenditure items for the financial commitments being consolidated
* We cannot lend for business purposes

For further guidance please contact us.


## SECTION 11 – Cladding

This section relates to customers who are looking to purchase, or who already own a property impacted by potentially unsafe cladding or balconies. These are known as External Wall Systems (EWS).

Multi storey buildings which have multiple occupancy and are either:
* Under 11 metres AND 4 storeys or less, anywhere in the UK, or
* 11 metres or more OR 5 storeys or more, in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland

Our valuation policy will ensure that a professional valuation is undertaken for these properties. Where the valuer has fire safety concerns with the External Wall System or any other fire safety concerns, they will request a completed External Wall Fire Review Form (EWS1), in line with RICS guidance. Our appointed valuer will check their database to confirm the property's EWS1 status. Where they are unable to do so, we will request the EWS1 form. The EWS1 form should be sent directly to us.

The EWS1 form is the responsibility of the building owner (property owner in Scotland) to undertake. They must appoint a qualified member of one of the appropriate professional bodies to complete and sign the form. The form will confirm that the EWS has been assessed and provide its safety rating. The rating will determine whether we are able to progress the case.

A rating of A1, A2 or B1 will mean that the valuer will determine whether the case can progress and where acceptable, provide an amended valuation report.

A rating of A3 or B2 will mean that the property will be declined where affected by cladding and remediation is required.

Multi storey buildings in England which have multiple occupancy and are either:
* 11 metres or more, or
* Have 5 or more storeys

Where a valuer has identified any significant fire safety concerns, or the EWS1 form rating is either A3 or B2, they'll let us know if remediation of the property has been agreed to be funded by either Government funding or by the Developer, if known. We'll then get in touch requesting the following:
* An executed Leaseholder Deed of Certificate
* An executed Landlord Certificate (for applications where the building is being fully remediated under the Building Safety Act or by the Developer, this certificate will not be required)

Please note that we aren't accepting applications from non-qualifying leaseholders for buildings that are not being remediated under the Building Safety Act.

We must be satisfied with the information provided to allow us to proceed. You can find more guidance on this documentation on the government website.

Existing Mortgage Customers:
We are here to support our existing customers who have a mortgage on a property that is impacted by potentially unsafe EWS. When their current mortgage deal ends we will offer a new mortgage product, just as we always would.

For changes to an existing Virgin Money mortgage we will assess each case based on individual circumstances. As a responsible lender, any application for additional borrowing from customers impacted by unsafe EWS will be carefully considered before a decision is made. For any other questions relating to EWS please refer to the FAQs provided by RICS or visit the governments website to view their guidance on cladding.


## SECTION 12 – Consumer Buy To Let

The Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD) Order, defines a Consumer Buy to Let (CBTL) Mortgage Contract as: a buy-to-let mortgage contract which is not entered into by the borrower wholly or predominantly for the purposes of a business carried on, or intended to be carried on, by the borrower.

We can consider a CBTL mortgage contract.


## SECTION 13 – Contractors

Daily Rate Contractors:
* We will lend to daily rate contractors who have a fixed rate of pay, work schedule and contract duration
* Income is calculated by the current contract multiplied by 46 weeks
* Where there is less than 1 month remaining on the current contract evidence of renewal required

* Contractors who earn under £50,000 must have 2 years' contracting experience and have had their contract renewed at least once. There is no minimum income requirement. The maximum LTV is 95%
* Contractors who earn £50,000 or more, have 1 year or more of contracting experience, and have had their contract renewed at least once are accepted to 95% LTV
* Contractors who earn £50,000 or more and have less than 1 year of contracting experience must have a minimum of 2 years' experience (employed or contracting) in same the industry. The maximum LTV is 70%
* It is acceptable for a contractor to have a limited company providing they do not employ other contractors. Offshore structures are not accepted
* We usually need customers to have no more than one contract, and where there has been a significant pay increase in the most recent contract we may need further information
* If a customer has significant recurring expenditure items showing on their business bank statements please contact us before applying – it could mean our contractor assessment isn't right for them or we may need to include the items in our expenditure assessment

IR35 and Umbrella Companies:
* Contractors operating inside IR35 and/or use of a payroll services company (PAYE umbrella company) are accepted
* When reviewing payslips, we will deduct any statutory employer costs (including employer National Insurance contributions and Apprenticeship Levy) and any payroll service costs from the gross pay before multiplying by 46 weeks

Fixed Term, Renewable and Seasonal Employment Contracts:

## SECTION 15 – Deposit

Gifted Deposits:
Where the deposit is being gifted, a letter or the Third Party Use of Personal Information / Gifted Deposit form must be obtained from the person, or persons, gifting the deposit to confirm that the deposit monies are a gift, and the person does not expect to be repaid these monies either whilst the borrower(s) owns the property or upon its sale.

Deposits that are sourced from Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCA) for example where the deposit monies have been raised via an open cooperative funding circle scheme are not acceptable as a source of deposit.


## SECTION 16 – Direct Debit

Payment by Direct Debit mandate is compulsory for all mortgages. Payments can be taken from an account on any day of the month between the 1st and the 28th. We cannot issue a mortgage offer until a fully completed Direct Debit mandate has been submitted. If no date is stated your payment will be taken on the 1st of the month.

If the client will have more than one mortgage product i.e. part and part, then we will require a Direct Debit mandate for each mortgage product.


## SECTION 17 – Discounted Purchase

Transactions at undervalue can occur where a property is being or has been acquired by way of a Deed of Gift, or for less than the full market value. For such a transaction to be acceptable to us there must be an existing associated relationship with the Vendor.

When the Loan to Value figure for these transactions are calculated, the lower of the purchase price and property valuation (i.e. the discounted price) is to be used, both the purchase price and the valuation amount need to be detailed within the application.

Applications will be considered up to 100% of the purchase price and the approval is subject to the normal credit requirements and conditions.

We also require the solicitor or licensed conveyancer to establish that the family member gifting the property is not insolvent and to arrange suitable indemnity insurance for the full value of the property if they deem it necessary.

Note: When an applicant is purchasing a property from a family member separate legal representation is required, the same solicitor or licensed conveyancer cannot act for both seller and buyer.

* Leases which contain a provision for periodic increase of the ground rent are acceptable if the amount remains reasonable throughout its term. Increases should usually be linked to RPI or similar. If subject to a multiplier, any multipliers which cause a doubling of rent every period of 15 years or less are not permitted
* Ground rent must not exceed £250 per annum at any point during the lease term. In Greater London it's £1,000. We don't accept indemnity policies for this matter, instead leases must be varied so that the ground rent does not rise above the threshold


## SECTION 40 – Legal Panel

Clydesdale Bank have an approved panel of solicitors and licensed conveyancers to provide legal services to customers buying a property and remortgaging. For further information including the list of the approved firms, please visit the Clydesdale Bank Approved Legal Panel page.


## SECTION 41 – Lending Into Retirement

After or Approaching Retirement:
* If a customer is already retired, or the term extends to or beyond their declared retirement date or their 71st birthday and they are within 10 years of either date we will use their pension income for affordability, or current income if lower

Over 10 Years Before Retirement:
* If the term extends to or beyond the customer's declared retirement date or their 71st birthday but the customer is not within 10 years of either date, we don't need proof of income in retirement but we do need to see that the customer is paying in to a pension plan


## SECTION 42 – Lending Limits

We conduct an overall affordability assessment and have no minimum income or rental cover requirement.

The maximum number of buy to let mortgages available to an individual is 3, with a maximum total borrowing of £1,000,000 with us. This increases to £1,500,000 provided no more than £1,000,000 is outside of London and South East England.

A maximum of 8 properties are allowed in the total portfolio.

We can only lend to portfolio landlords if they are requesting a remortgage with no additional borrowing.

London and South East defined as Greater London (postcodes E, EC, N, NW, SE, SW, W, WC, BR, CR, DA, EN, HA, IG, KT, RM, SM, TW, or UB), Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, East Sussex, Hampshire, Isle of Wight, Kent, Oxfordshire, Surrey and West Sussex.


## SECTION 43 – Let-To-Buy

* The client is moving into rented accommodation or living with a family member

Existing Mortgage Considerations:
If the client is:

* Converting the mortgage to a Buy to Let with another lender,
we may consider lending on the new residential property.

We will require confirmation of the expected rental income from the existing property. Acceptable forms of evidence include:
* A letter from ARLA (Association of Residential Letting Agents) or the Scottish Association of Landlords confirming the expected monthly rental income; or
* A valid Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) agreement; or
* An independent valuation carried out by the external mortgage provider confirming the expected rental income

* Home improvements (subject to restrictions - see Capital Raising section)

We cannot lend for business purposes.

For further guidance please contact us.


## SECTION 45 – Loan Size

We accept Buy to Let mortgage applications ranging from £80,000 up to £1,000,000. These amounts are subject to individual product restrictions. For properties located in London and South East England, the upper limit increases to £1,500,000.

The maximum Loan to Value (LTV) ratio depends on the loan amount and mortgage type (Capital & Interest or Interest Only):
* For loans up to £500,000: Capital & Interest: Up to 80% of the property value. Interest Only: Up to 80% of the property value

Location Details: For loans above £1,000,000, the property must be in London or South East England. This includes Greater London (postcodes starting with E, EC, N, NW, SE, SW, W, WC, BR, CR, DA, EN, HA, IG, KT, RM, SM, TW, or UB) as well as Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, East Sussex, Hampshire, Isle of Wight, Kent, Oxfordshire, Surrey, and West Sussex.


## SECTION 46 – Lump Sum Payments

The flexibility of our mortgage products allow our customers the option of making lump sum payments in addition to their regular payment amount. Lump sum payments can only be lodged once the first payment has been credited to the mortgage account.

Our fixed rate products allow customers to make lump sum payments of up to 10% of the mortgage balance during each year of the fixed rate product without incurring an early repayment charge. There are no penalties for making lump sum payments to our offset discounted products.

It is important to note that customers cannot reduce their regular payment amount following a lump sum payment if they are still in a fixed or discounted period.


## SECTION 47 – Maximum Age

We will accept applications for Buy to Lets up to the age of 75 at the end of the mortgage term.


## SECTION 48 – Maximum Ltv

We offer flexible lending based on the loan-to-value ratio (LTV), which is the percentage of the property's value you can borrow. Here's how it works:

* At 75% LTV, you can borrow up to £1 million. This limit increases to £1.5 million if the property is in London or South East England
* At 80% LTV (including any product fees), you can borrow up to £500,000 for an Interest Only mortgage or up to £750,000 for a Capital & Interest mortgage

Maximum Loan-to-Value (LTV) Limits:
The maximum LTV depends on the loan amount and the type of mortgage:

* For loans up to £500,000:
  * Interest Only: Up to 80% of the property value
  * Capital & Interest: Up to 80% of the property value

* For loans between £500,001 and £750,000:
  * Interest Only: Up to 75% of the property value
  * Capital & Interest: Up to 80% of the property value

* For loans between £750,001 and £1,000,000:
  * Interest Only: Up to 75% of the property value
  * Capital & Interest: Up to 75% of the property value

* For loans between £1,000,001 and £1,500,000:
  * Interest Only: Up to 75% of the property value
  * Capital & Interest: Up to 75% of the property value

Note: You can add a product fee to your loan, but the total amount you borrow cannot exceed 80% of the property's value.

Special Condition for Larger Loans: If you're borrowing more than £1,000,000, the property must be located in London or South East England. This includes Greater London (postcodes E, EC, N, NW, SE, SW, W, WC, BR, CR, DA, EN, HA, IG, KT, RM, SM, TW, or UB) as well as Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, East Sussex, Hampshire, Isle of Wight, Kent, Oxfordshire, Surrey, and West Sussex.

New Build Flats:
* For new build flats, the maximum LTV is 70% of the property value


## SECTION 49 – Maximum Number Of Buy To Lets

* The maximum number of buy to let mortgages available to an individual is 3, with a maximum total borrowing of £1,000,000 with us (this increases to £1,500,000 provided no more than £1,000,000 is outside of London and South East England)
* A maximum of 8 properties are allowed in the total portfolio
* We can only lend to portfolio landlords if they are requesting a remortgage with no additional borrowing

London & South East defined as: Greater London (post codes starting E, EC, N, NW, SE, SW, W, WC, BR, CR, DA, EN, HA, IG, KT, RM, SM, TW, or UB), Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, East Sussex, Hampshire, Isle of Wight, Kent, Oxfordshire, Surrey, West Sussex


## SECTION 50 – Minimum Income

We don't have a minimum income or rental cover requirement. Instead, we conduct an overall affordability assessment. Use our affordability calculator to find out how much your customers can borrow.

Please note: We require evidence of income for all applications, income must be in pounds sterling, and individual policies may have minimum income requirements (e.g. foreign nationals).

Here are our packaging requirements.


## SECTION 51 – Minimum Term

5 years (or the product term if longer).


## SECTION 52 – Mortgage Free Property (Unencumbered)

One free standard valuation is available on properties worth £3m, or less.

Please ensure your clients solicitor is listed on the bank's Approved Legal Panel.


## SECTION 53 – Multi Unit Freehold Blocks (Mufbs)

A multi unit freehold block is a single freehold building which contains 2 or more self-contained units which don't have their own individual leases.

We can accept MUFBs where the property is split into a maximum of 4 self-contained flats (no shared kitchen, bathroom, etc), each let on a single tenancy agreement with its own utilities. Each flat must have an internal floor area of at least 30sq.m. The property should be a house which has been converted into flats, but the building has been left on a single freehold title without the creation of individual leases for each flat. Our security will be the freehold title upon which we would place a single mortgage.

For all types of property our valuers must be able to find suitably comparable properties in the area and must be able to confirm there is suitable demand for the type of property in its area. This can be a particular challenge for MUFBs, and consequently we are more likely to be able to assist with higher value properties which present as simple and common house conversions in areas of particularly high demand and transactional volume.

If the flats were on individual leasehold titles, we would require separate mortgage applications per flat.


## SECTION 54 – Neighbouring Land

Where the applicant owns land that neighbours the security property, we will need a mortgage over the neighbouring land as well. 

This will only apply if:
* Access to the security property is gained over the neighbouring land; and/or
* Services for the security property run over the neighbouring land

This won't apply where the applicant owns multiple flats in a building.


## SECTION 55 – New Build

A property is considered a "new build" if it meets any of the following criteria:
* It has never been occupied, including converted properties where the property has remained unoccupied since the conversion was completed
* It is a property built or marketed by the builder or developer within the last 2 years, regardless of whether it has been previously tenanted
* It has been converted into a flat within the 2 years preceding the mortgage application, as part of the conversion of a former mill, factory, school, church, council tower block, or similar structure

Buy to Let Maximum Loan to Value (LTV):
The maximum LTV depends on the property type:
* House: Up to 80% of the property value
* Flat or Maisonette: Up to 70% of the property value

Important Note: A new build property must be covered by an NHBC Certificate or an equivalent form of guarantee cover. Acceptable policies for lending purposes, as approved by the Council of Mortgage Lenders, can be viewed in the UK Finance Mortgage Lenders Handbook.

Incentives:
* Cash Incentives: Cash incentives are allowed up to 5% of the purchase price. This includes cashback deals, Stamp Duty paid, payment of professional fees (e.g., solicitors, surveyors, etc.), and guaranteed rental payments for a specific period. All these are considered cash incentives
* Non-Cash Incentives: Non-cash incentives include items fixed or fitted to the property or white goods. These are accepted without affecting the loan amount


## SECTION 56 – Offers

Mortgage offers are valid for a period of 6 months from the date of issue. If completion does not take place within this period, a new offer may be required subject to re-assessment of the application and current lending criteria.

We may extend the offer validity period in exceptional circumstances. Please contact us to discuss if an extension is required.


## SECTION 57 – Offset

What Types of Accounts Can Be Linked to Our Offset Mortgages?
Clydesdale Bank's current and savings accounts have been updated with a Virgin Money makeover, allowing you to link a broader range of Virgin Money accounts to a Clydesdale Bank offset mortgage. The account must have a sort code starting with 82. We offer both current products available for sale and products no longer available to new customers but still eligible for linking if the customer already holds them.

Current Available Products (Eligible for Linking):
  - Club M Account
  - Club M Saver Account
  - M Plus Account
  - M Plus Saver

Products No Longer Available (Still Eligible if Held):
  - Private Current Account
  - Private Savings Account
  - Current Account Control
  - Current Account Tracker
  - Savings Account Plus
  - Savings Account Plus – Offset
  - Offset Business Current Account

Note: Virgin Money current and savings accounts are not automatically opened during the Clydesdale Bank offset mortgage application process. Customers must arrange this separately.

A customer can link up to 6 Virgin Money accounts (any combination of eligible current and savings accounts) to their Clydesdale Bank offset mortgage. If only one account is linked, it must be a Virgin Money current account.

Opening Virgin Money Current and Savings Accounts:
For new business applications, we will proactively contact your customer at the offer stage to help them open a personal current or savings account to link with their new offset mortgage upon completion. We will attempt two phone calls and send two follow-up emails before finalizing the process. We'll also keep you updated to ensure everything is on track.

How Does an Offset Mortgage Work?
The interest a customer pays on their mortgage is calculated based on the outstanding mortgage balance minus the amount in their linked savings accounts. For example, with a £500,000 mortgage and £100,000 in a linked savings account, interest is only charged on the remaining £400,000. No interest is earned on the linked savings, but customers retain full access to their funds if needed. The more money in credit balances, the more interest they can save.

Key Point: Even if the savings balance grows, the monthly mortgage payment remains unchanged. However, a larger portion of the payment goes toward reducing the mortgage balance, saving more on interest. For repayment mortgages, this can also help shorten the loan term.

Can a Customer Link a Yorkshire Bank Account to Their Offset Mortgage?
No, only Clydesdale Bank products (with a sort code starting with 82) can be linked to an offset mortgage.

How Does an Interest Only Offset Mortgage Work?
For interest-only mortgages, the offset benefit allows a portion of the monthly payment to reduce the outstanding capital balance. However, offsetting does not lower the monthly payment amount. Customers must continue paying the full monthly amount as outlined in their mortgage offer.

What Happens If a Customer Fully Offsets Their Mortgage Balance?
If the total credit balance across the offset portfolio exceeds the mortgage balance, the customer pays no interest. Their monthly repayment then reduces the capital (outstanding balance), and they earn credit interest on the overall offset balance. For a detailed breakdown of interest charged, customers can contact our Mortgage Services Team at 0800 121 4203.


## SECTION 58 – Parental Leave

If an applicant is on parental leave (e.g., maternity or paternity leave):
* We will use their return-to-work income, subject to confirmation of both the intended return date and income level (must be within the next 12 months)
* We must also understand how the applicant will manage financial commitments during their leave (e.g., through employee benefits, statutory pay, partner's income, or savings)
* Any anticipated childcare costs must be included in the application

For packaging requirements, please refer to our packaging guide.


## SECTION 59 – Portfolio Landlords

We can only lend to portfolio landlords if they are requesting a remortgage with no additional borrowing.

For customers looking to borrow additional money or buy a new Buy to Let (BTL) property, we can only assist if they do not meet the definition of a portfolio landlord—defined as borrowers with four or more mortgaged BTL properties. This includes any BTLs held in a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), and for joint applications, all mortgages are considered whether held together or separately.

To help you determine if we can assist your customers, here's a breakdown based on the number of mortgaged BTLs they already have:
* If they have 0 mortgaged BTLs, they can buy a new BTL, convert an existing residential property to a BTL, remortgage with extra borrowing, or remortgage with no extra borrowing
* If they have 1 mortgaged BTL, they can buy a new BTL, convert an existing residential property to a BTL, remortgage with extra borrowing, or remortgage with no extra borrowing
* If they have 2 mortgaged BTLs, they can buy a new BTL, convert an existing residential property to a BTL, remortgage with extra borrowing, or remortgage with no extra borrowing
* If they have 3 mortgaged BTLs, they cannot buy a new BTL or convert an existing residential property to a BTL, but they can remortgage with no extra borrowing
* If they have 4 or more mortgaged BTLs, they cannot buy a new BTL or convert an existing residential property to a BTL, but they can remortgage with no extra borrowing

Note: The count of mortgaged BTLs should include all mortgages with any lender, not just Clydesdale Bank.

Limits:
* The maximum number of BTLs with Clydesdale Bank is 3, with a maximum total borrowing of £1 million (£1.5 million if £500k or more of the mortgages are on properties in the Greater London area)
* We cannot lend to anyone who has more than 8 BTLs in their portfolio, whether or not they are mortgaged


## SECTION 60 – Probation

If the customer is in probation or has not been in their current job for 6 months, this is acceptable as long as they have a permanent contract (as opposed to short term) and they've received their first payslip.

## SECTION 62 – Procurement Fee

Procuration fees will be paid in accordance with your contract with the Bank.


## SECTION 63 – Product Fees

The product fee can be added to the loan, provided the total borrowing does not exceed 95% LTV for a residential loan, or 80% LTV for Buy to Let.

Please see the Loan To Value section for more information on our LTV restrictions.


## SECTION 64 – Product Switching

We allow product switching on pipeline cases, which means you can switch your customer's previously selected product onto a new product from our new business range available at that time. Here's some key information:

* We allow a change of product using the current product range as many times as needed prior to completion
* This can be pre-offer or post-offer, up until we have received the Certificate of Title from the solicitor. We can't make changes to the product after the COT has been received
* Complete our Change of Application Form and upload it on the application portal
* Once we've changed the product, we'll send a new offer to the customer. If the case is not yet at offer stage, we'll send an updated illustration instead

Please note: We allow product switching on Product Transfer pipeline cases for existing customers too.


## SECTION 65 – Product Transfer

Your customer can apply for a product transfer up to 180 days before the expiry of their current fixed-rate product.

Applicable Criteria:
The following conditions must be met for your customer's mortgage:
* Payments are currently up to date
* There has been no change in the use of the property, such as it still being their buy to let property
* There has been no deterioration in the customer's financial circumstances that could impact their ability to meet mortgage repayments
* There has been no change to the regulatory status of the mortgage

Important Notes:
* Valuation: If the valuation figure provided in the application exceeds the value we currently hold on file, we will arrange an index valuation at no cost to the client to determine the loan-to-value ratio
* Offset: Any linked accounts will remain in place for a new offset mortgage. However, if your client opts for a fixed-rate mortgage, they will lose the ability to offset personal or business accounts once the new fixed-rate mortgage begins

Additional Options:
During the final 3 months of a new product switch application, customers can make further amendments to their mortgage without incurring an Early Repayment Charge. These include:
* Making a lump sum reduction to the mortgage
* Eligibility to access previously overpaid funds through a borrow-back option

All our current on-sale products are available to product transfer customers, provided the above criteria and product conditions are met. For full product information, please visit our Products pages.


## SECTION 66 – Promotion Or Pay Rise

If an applicant has recently received a promotion or pay rise, we may be able to use the new income level subject to:
* Confirmation from the employer of the new salary/income level
* Evidence of the increase (e.g., new contract, payslip showing the increase)
* The increase being sustainable and permanent (not temporary)

For significant increases or where the promotion is very recent, we may require additional evidence or may use a blended approach. Please contact us to discuss individual cases.


## SECTION 67 – Property

Unacceptable Properties:
This section provides general guidance on the types of properties that the bank will not consider for lending. This list is not exhaustive, and any queries not covered here should be directed to us before submitting an application.

We do not lend on the following types of property:
* Properties with agricultural restrictions
* Freehold flats or maisonettes
* Live/work units
* Properties altered or adapted for commercial use, including those where part of the land is leased to a third party for commercial or other purposes
* Mobile homes or river boats
* Shared equity properties
* Low-cost housing or properties under restricted resale covenant schemes
* Sheltered housing or properties with age restrictions for occupants
* Properties that cannot be occupied for 365 days per year
* Care homes, kennels, catteries, caravan parks, and working farms, which are considered predominantly commercial and unsuitable for residential mortgages
* Studio flats with internal floor space less than 30 square meters
* Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs)
* Properties with charges of part, where our mortgage does not cover the entire property or title number
* Properties with a flying freehold element exceeding 15% of the gross floor area

If you have any queries not listed, please contact us initially.

Buy to Let:
We will consider residential properties in either owner-occupied or predominantly tenanted areas. Decisions will take into account the demand for purchasing and renting the specific type of property being considered.

Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES):
Regulations effective from April 1, 2018, require that a property's Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) must show an energy rating of E or above to be let, subject to certain exemptions. For all Buy to Let (BTL) cases, the bank's valuers will verify compliance with MEES. If the EPC does not meet this standard, the application will be declined as unsuitable security for BTL lending.

Ex-Local Authority Flats/Maisonettes:
Mortgages and remortgages on former local authority flats and maisonettes in blocks of 7 storeys or less are acceptable, provided the property meets our guidelines. However, deck or balcony access that is deemed detrimental to the use or value of the flat will lead to a decline. Acceptable properties must have suitable entrance doors to stairwells and be located in areas with good owner-occupier demand.

Flats Above/Adjacent to Commercial Premises:
Properties located above or adjacent to commercial premises are acceptable, subject to a valuer's assessment ensuring the commercial use does not negatively impact demand or enjoyment of the property. The entrance must not be via the commercial premises, and properties immediately above or adjacent to food, drink, or dry cleaners are typically unacceptable.

Land/Large Acreage:
The valuation will include a maximum of 2 acres of land, which will form the security for Clydesdale Bank. Any added value from additional land will not be included in the valuation. While there is no strict overall limit, we consider saleability in relation to the size and type of residence.

New Home Guarantees:
Properties built or converted within the last 10 years must be covered by an acceptable warranty or a professional consultant's certificate, which cannot be offered retrospectively. Acceptable warranties include:
* Advantage HCI
* Build Assure
* Build Zone
* Building Life Plans (BLP)
* Castle 10 / Checkmate
* Global Home Warranties
* Homeproof (formerly Aedis)
* International Construction Warranties (ICW)
* Local Authority Building Control (LABC)
* National House Building Council (NHBC)
* Premier Guarantee
* Protek
* Q Assure
* Thomas Miller Specialty Construction

We also accept a UK Finance standard professional consultant's certificate for a single dwelling or a flat converted from a single dwelling, but not for new build flats or developments with more than one dwelling. This is subject to meeting section 6.7 requirements of the UK Finance handbook for England and Wales and Scotland, including appropriate professional indemnity insurance and membership in an approved professional body.

We do not lend on property conversions prior to or during construction. Larger scheme conversions, such as office-to-residential with a builder/developer selling multiple units, will be evaluated similarly to new build lending on the completed property only.

Freehold Flats:
We do not accept freehold flats.

High Rise Blocks of Flats:
We accept properties in blocks taller than 7 storeys under the following conditions:
* The block was originally constructed for owner occupation, not local authority housing
* New or recently constructed/converted blocks, where the mortgaged property is for full owner occupation or shared ownership, are likely acceptable subject to valuation
* The block must have a concrete or steel frame with an external face of brick, block, or other robust cladding (e.g., stone, glass, or metal)
* Access to flats on the 5th floor or above must include a lift; otherwise, the application will be declined
* For flats on the 4th storey or below, a lift is not required regardless of the block's height

Japanese Knotweed:
Japanese Knotweed is categorised as:
* Category A: Causing visible damage to the property
* Category B: Impacting the amenity space of the property
* Category C: Within the boundaries but not impacting the amenity space of the property
* Category D: On a neighbouring property or land

* For categories A & B, the surveyor will usually request a report by a PCA or ISSE registered firm. All recommended remedial works must be undertaken and covered by an insurance-backed 10-year guarantee, which must be property-specific and transferable to subsequent owners and mortgagees in possession. Funding for the works must be ring-fenced and protected by bond-pay, escrow, or similar
* For categories C & D, we are usually able to lend with no further requirements

Occupancy Restrictions:
We will not accept the following occupancy restrictions:
* Holiday Lets
* Unable to occupy a property for 365 days per year
* Agricultural Restrictions / Ties
* Section 106 (any, including affordable housing, for example any re-sale restrictions geographically or by person type)
* Age restriction, for example retirement flats for over 55s
* Live / Work units

Construction - Standard and Non-Standard:

Standard Construction for Residential Properties:
* Main walls are of masonry (brick, block, or stone) with cavity or solid walls
* Main walls of modern timber frame with a masonry external skin are classed as standard construction
* Main walls of modern steel frame with a masonry external skin are classed as standard construction if originally constructed with an NHBC guarantee
* Main pitched roof covering is tiled, slated, or a modern metal sheet roof (not corrugated iron)
* Main flat roof covering is felt, asphalt, or GRP (up to 100% purpose-built flats, 25% other properties)
* Main roof structure is of timber cut or trussed, or a steel framework

Properties of Non-Standard Construction:
* If the property is of a non-standard form of construction, it will be considered on an individual basis
* The property must be well maintained and in satisfactory condition
* A suitable demand and market for the property is essential, as recommended and confirmed by the valuer
* A suitable new build warranty is also required
* Timber clad properties are unacceptable
* For any other non-standard construction type, please contact us in the first instance

Modern Methods of Construction (MMC):
* Each form of construction will be considered individually on its merits
* Each property requires a physical inspection and valuation by one of the Bank's Valuers, who will advise on condition, marketability, and saleability
* As a minimum, MMC properties must have the necessary unqualified NHBC guarantees or similar, and BPS 2020 & BPS 2021 certification for materials used
* The property should be in a location where marketability is not an issue and must be acceptable to insurers
* If you have an MMC property, please contact us in the first instance

Timber Framed Construction:
* Modern factory-produced timber-framed construction, generally by major house builders since the 1960s, is acceptable if constructed with an outer skin of brick/stone or rendered blockwork, subject to individual inspection and valuer satisfaction with construction methods, site supervision, and storage facilities on new properties and developments
* Lightweight thin claddings (e.g., rendered boarding, timber like shiplap, or similar) are generally not acceptable unless decorative and a relatively small proportion of the wall surface
* Some modern timber-framed dwellings with a cement render finish on expanded metal mesh or similar, applied directly to the timber frame, are acceptable if they have NHBC approval and TRADA certification, subject to valuer comments
* "Lightweight" Softwood Timber Frames are not acceptable (e.g., "between the wars" timber "garden shed" construction, often with asbestos sheet cladding and roofs of asbestos tiles or felt)
* Medieval and/or Historic Timber Frame Houses are acceptable, subject to individual inspection and saleability, if made of hardwood timber framed construction with infill material

Escalating Ground Rent:
* We will consider properties where the lease contains a provision for a periodic increase of the ground rent, provided the amount remains reasonable throughout the term of the lease
* Any increase must be linked to the equivalent percentage change in the Retail Price Index (RPI) or a similar index
* If subject to a multiplier, any multipliers causing a doubling of rent every period of 15 years or less are not permitted
* If you are unsure if the lease terms are unreasonable, please refer the details to us


## SECTION 68 – Proof Of Rental Payments

We accept the following documents from the client to evidence the rental income they are receiving from their existing buy-to-let properties:

Property Rental Income:
* Tenancy Agreement: Must be current, in standard form, and signed by all parties. Note that this is not suitable as evidence for rental income from the property being mortgaged
* OR
* Bank Statements: Copies of the last 3 months' statements must be held on file with rental income annotated

In addition, for any new Buy to Let properties, we will instruct a professional valuation and use the rental income estimated by the valuer within our application.


## SECTION 69 – References

All applications will be subject to a credit search and credit score. We may also request full references or telephone references from an employer or accountant.


## SECTION 70 – Regulated Btl

We do not accept applications for MCOB Regulated Buy to Let mortgages. All Buy to Let applications must be non-regulated.


## SECTION 71 – Remortgage Package

We offer a range of products with a remortgage package of one free valuation and free basic legal work. The free valuation is available for properties valued up to £3m. If the property is valued over £3m the full valuation fee is payable. The maximum property value for free basic legal work is £2m, and there is no maximum loan size. The package also applies to capital raising on an unencumbered property.

We'll choose a firm to complete the free basic legal work under the package. Additional costs specific to the customer's circumstances may apply and the customer will be provided a tariff of charges by the firm acting when they're appointed. There will always be at a funds transfer fee of up to £35 to send remortgage funds to the existing mortgage provider or the customer's bank account.

Free Basic Legal Work Eligibility:
Most transactions are eligible for the free basic legal work but it's not available where any documents require execution under a Power of Attorney or for property held in trust.

In the following circumstances (not exhaustive) the standard legal fees incentive is available but additional fees usually apply: Transfer of equity, stair-casing to 100% ownership, Joint Borrower Sole Owner, charges on the title, solar panel leases, 3rd party solicitor involvement, restrictions on title.

Customers who want to appoint their own legal rep can do so at their own cost. Their chosen legal rep will act for the customer and Virgin Money and must be on our Approved Legal Panel.


## SECTION 72 – Rental Calculation

We don't have a minimum rental cover requirement.

When calculating affordability for a Buy to Let application we will take the following into account:
* Earned and Rental income
* Existing credit commitments (this will include an additional stress payment for any other mortgages the customer holds)
* Expenditure associated with the rental property
* Any other essential or committed expenditure

Please use our affordability calculator to find out how much your customers can borrow.


## SECTION 73 – Rental Cover

We don't have a minimum rental cover requirement. Instead, we conduct an overall affordability assessment that takes into account:

* Earned and rental income
* Existing credit commitments (including additional stress payments for any other mortgages the customer holds)
* Expenditure associated with the rental property
* Any other essential or committed expenditure

Please use our affordability calculator to find out how much your customers can borrow.


## SECTION 74 – Replacement Property

If your client is selling their existing Buy to Let property and purchasing a replacement Buy to Let property, we may consider the application subject to:

* The sale of the existing property completing before or simultaneously with the purchase of the replacement property
* The replacement property meeting all current lending criteria
* The customer meeting current affordability requirements
* Maximum LTV restrictions being met

For further guidance, please contact us before submitting an application.


## SECTION 75 – Repayment Strategies For Interest Only Mortgages

For Interest Only Buy to Let mortgages, we require evidence of a credible repayment strategy. Acceptable repayment strategies include:

* Sale of other assets (e.g., other properties, investments)
* Regular capital repayments from income
* Other acceptable repayment vehicles

If the client advises they have an alternate repayment strategy to repay the capital component of the BTL loan (other than sale of property), the details of the repayment strategy(s) can be captured on the additional information section of the online application form.

For further guidance, please contact us to discuss individual cases.

## SECTION 78 – Second Jobs

We accept 100% of income from a second job, provided:

* The income has been consistently received for at least 12 months
* Evidence of the income is provided (payslips or bank statements)
* The income is sustainable and likely to continue

These property types are not suitable for Buy to Let lending purposes.


## SECTION 80 – Self Employed

For self-employed applicants, we assess income based on their business structure:

* Applicants with a combined shareholding of less than 25% in a limited company are treated as employed
* If 25% or more, applicants are treated as self-employed

Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs):
* Salaried partners/members with no shareholding are considered employed
* Equity partners or those receiving profit share are usually treated as self-employed

Income Assessment:
* We use the lower of the last 2 years' net profit (after tax) or the most recent year's net profit
* For limited companies, we assess salary plus dividends
* We may request business bank statements to verify income

For full details, refer to our Self-Employed Income Policy and packaging requirements.

Important: If your customer has BTLs, also see Rental income section.


## SECTION 81 – Solicitors

Clydesdale Bank has an approved panel of solicitors and licensed conveyancers to provide legal services to customers buying a property and remortgaging.

For remortgage applications with our remortgage package, we'll choose a firm to complete the free basic legal work. Customers who want to appoint their own legal representative can do so at their own cost, provided their chosen legal representative is on our Approved Legal Panel.

For further information including the list of approved firms, please visit the Clydesdale Bank Approved Legal Panel page.


## SECTION 82 – Student Lettings

We do not accept Buy to Let applications for properties that are let or intended to be let specifically to students under student letting arrangements.

Standard Buy to Let properties that happen to be let to students may be considered, subject to standard criteria and valuer assessment.


## SECTION 83 – Telegraphic Transfer

For remortgage applications, there will always be a funds transfer fee of up to £35 to send remortgage funds to the existing mortgage provider or the customer's bank account. This fee applies even where free basic legal work is included in the remortgage package.


## SECTION 84 – Tenancy

For Buy to Let properties, we require evidence of the expected rental income. This can be provided through:

* A professional valuation confirming the expected rental income
* An existing tenancy agreement (for remortgage applications)
* A letter from a letting agent confirming expected rental income

Tenancy agreements should be:
* In standard form (Assured Shorthold Tenancy for England and Wales, or equivalent for Scotland)
* Signed by all parties
* Current and valid

For background Buy to Let properties, please refer to the Background Buy-to-Lets section for evidence requirements.


## SECTION 85 – Term

Minimum Term:
* 5 years (or the product term if longer)

Maximum Term:
* The mortgage term must not extend beyond the applicant's 75th birthday (75 years and 364 days at the end of the mortgage term)

For lending into retirement, please refer to the Lending into Retirement section.


## SECTION 86 – Top Slicing

Top slicing allows us to use surplus earned income to cover a rental shortfall in Buy to Let affordability assessments.

We may consider top slicing where:
* The rental income alone does not meet our affordability requirements
* The applicant has sufficient earned income to cover the shortfall
* The overall affordability assessment is acceptable

Top slicing is assessed on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us to discuss individual cases before submitting an application.


## SECTION 87 – Transcripts

For Scottish property valuations on residential applications at 90% LTV or below, a transcript from a Home Buyers Report may be accepted if:

* The valuation is 90 days old or less
* The surveying firm/surveyor is on the bank's panel
* A fee of £100 is paid for the transcript

A full bank valuation is needed if outside this criteria.

Note: Transcripts are not accepted for Buy to Let applications.


## SECTION 88 – Undervalue Transactions

Transactions at undervalue can occur where a property is being or has been acquired by way of a Deed of Gift, or for less than the full market value. For such a transaction to be acceptable to us there must be an existing associated relationship with the Vendor.

When the Loan to Value figure for these transactions are calculated, the lower of the purchase price and property valuation (i.e. the discounted price) is to be used. Both the purchase price and the valuation amount need to be detailed within the application.

Applications will be considered up to 100% of the purchase price and the approval is subject to the normal credit requirements and conditions.

We also require the solicitor or licensed conveyancer to establish that the family member gifting the property is not insolvent and to arrange suitable indemnity insurance for the full value of the property if they deem it necessary.

Note: When an applicant is purchasing a property from a family member separate legal representation is required, the same solicitor or licensed conveyancer cannot act for both seller and buyer.

For further details, please refer to the Discounted Purchase section.


## SECTION 89 – Valuation Fees


### Valuation report


The only valuation type available is a lender's valuation report which is for Clydesdale to calculate how much we can lend. This may involve a physical inspection of the property or be completed remotely without visiting the property. The customer may want to separately instruct a firm of their choosing to carry out a valuation or survey.


### Fees


We offer a range of products with one free valuation for properties valued up to £3m. If the property is valued over £3m we'll cover the first £1,640 of the valuation fee. Our product details will make clear if a free valuation applies.

The fees below include VAT and an administration fee. The cost to Clydesdale may differ from the fee charged.

We may also charge a reinspection fee of £58.75 where a valuation expires and needs to be updated or where work has been carried out and the valuation needs to be updated.
