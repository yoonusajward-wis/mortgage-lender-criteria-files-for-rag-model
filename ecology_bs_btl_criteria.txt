## OVERVIEW

---

We are a building society that specialises in mortgages for buy-to-let projects which meet specific energy ratings - whether you are looking for a self-build property to buy-to-let or improving the energy performance of an existing property to buy-to-let, see our buy-to-let mortgage in the UK.

YOUR PROPERTY MAY BE REPOSSESSED IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP REPAYMENTS ON YOUR MORTGAGE

# =================================================================================

# WHAT WE LEND ON

We are experts in providing buy-to-let mortgages for self-build, renovation, conversion projects and where you are extensively improving the energy performance of a property. We don't have a 'tick box' approach to assessing projects – in many instances, we'll welcome projects that standard lenders may not accept. We will consider:

• Energy efficient self-build projects
• Renovations to existing residential properties that improve the energy efficiency
• Barn conversion projects

Our mortgages are available in the UK (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland).

# =================================================================================

# OUR APPROACH TO LENDING FOR BUY-TO-LET MORTGAGES

• We release stage payments during the project as and when the value of your property increases during the works
• Our buy-to-let Variable Rate applies during the works and our discounts are applied from the date we receive evidence that the works are completed and, if applicable, the Energy Standard rating required has been achieved.

# =================================================================================

# OUR STANDARD OF SERVICE

Where a mortgage is not regulated by the FCA (as shown on the 'Key features' tab), you will be provided with full information about the mortgage products available from the Society so that you can make an informed decision as to which is suitable for your requirements.

# =================================================================================

# C-CHANGE DISCOUNTS EXPLAINED

As a building society with a unique mission to build a greener society, we lend on projects and properties that support our aims through their reduced impact on our environment. Making your home energy efficient is a major way you can support tackling climate change – while saving on your energy bills.

We reward borrowers whose properties are energy efficient (therefore have lower carbon emissions) with our C-Change discounts off our Variable Rate which helps them save money on their mortgage. We call our discounts 'C-Change discounts' simply because we're aiming to make a 'sea-change' of difference to our climate with each property or project we fund.

The level of our C-Change sustainable homes or C-Change retrofit discount that applies is based on the Energy Standard rating achieved on the self-build, off-site build, renovation or conversion when the work is completed. Our C-Change energy improvements discount is based on the qualifying energy measures being installed. The discount is applied from the date we receive evidence that the work has been completed and if applicable the Energy Standard rating required has been achieved.

## WHEN YOUR BUY-TO-LET PROJECT IS COMPLETE

---

For us to apply the C-Change sustainable homes or C-Change retrofit, once your work is complete you need to provide an Energy Standard certificate and, if applicable an Architect or Building Control certificate. Or, for us to apply the C-Change energy improvement discount, please send us all invoices for qualifying works.

The discounts are only applied to our Variable Rate from the date we receive evidence that the work has been completed and, if applicable, the Energy Standard rating required has been achieved.

## HOW WE WORK OUT YOUR BUY-TO-LET VARIABLE MORTGAGE RATE:

---

Buy-to-let Variable Rate (VR) minus C-Change discount = Variable Mortgage Rate
