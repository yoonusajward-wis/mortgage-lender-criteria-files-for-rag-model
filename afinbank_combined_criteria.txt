### Summary

Below we have summarised the key terms we have used in the terms and conditions, but you should make sure that you read the terms and conditions in full.

| Key term | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Total loan amount | We will lend you the total loan amount, which we will send to you after we have taken certain fees as set out in clause 8.3 of the terms and conditions. |
| Monthly payment | You need to pay us each monthly payment as set out in your mortgage offer letter (or any changed monthly payment) on time.<br><br>If you have a repayment mortgage (see your mortgage offer letter), each monthly payment is calculated so that the total loan amount you have borrowed is repaid by the end of the term, along with the interest.<br><br>If you have an interest-only mortgage (see your mortgage offer letter), your monthly payment is calculated so that the interest is covered by the payments over the period of the mortgage. You must put arrangements in place to repay this at the end of the term as per the repayment terms outlined in your agreement. |
| Payment due date | Your first monthly payment will fall due one calendar month after the date on which the total loan amount is advanced. If there is no corresponding date in the month, the monthly payment will fall due on the last day of that month. Subsequent monthly payments are payable on the payment due date. If the payment due date falls on a day which is not a business day, then the monthly payment will be due on the next business day in the same month (if there is one), or the immediately preceding business day (if there is not). |
| Changing your monthly payment | We may change the amount of your monthly payment during your mortgage. Some examples of when we might do this are in clause 5.7 of the terms and conditions. If we change your monthly payment, we will give you reasonable notice and may in certain circumstances give you up to 28 days' notice (see clause 5.8 of the terms and conditions). |
| Changing the payment due date | You can change your payment due date at any time. If the change means you need to pay extra interest, we will tell you the amount and when you need to pay it.<br>You can select a payment due date that works better for you up until the 28th day of each month. If you wish to amend your payment due date, you can do so by contacting us on 03333442974 and requesting the change for the following month (subject to clause 5.10 of the terms and conditions). |
| Interest | We add interest to the outstanding balance from the date we advance the total loan amount. The interest rate you pay is shown in your mortgage offer letter. For more information on how we calculate interest and when it is payable, please see clause 4 of the terms and conditions. |
| Early repayment | You can repay all or part of your mortgage at any time. You may have to pay an early repayment charge if you repay all or some of your mortgage during a fixed-rate period, and such repayment charges are as set out in your mortgage offer letter. |
| Event of Default | In some circumstances we can ask you to repay the outstanding balance straight away (for example, if you do not make your payments on time). Clause 9 of the terms and conditions sets out when we can do this. Please make sure you understand when this could happen. This is important because if we ask you to pay the outstanding balance and you do not pay it, we could take legal action against you. This could include repossessing and selling the property or we may appoint a receiver. |
| Charges | In certain circumstances, we may add a charge to your account for work we have to do to manage your account (for example, if you miss payments).<br>We have enclosed a tariff of charges, which is also on our website at [afinbank.com/mortgage-fee-tariff](https://afinbank.com/mortgage-fee-tariff). We can change and introduce new charges at any time (see clause 8 of the terms and conditions). |
| Our right to change our agreement | Clause 10 of the terms and conditions sets out our rights to change the terms of our agreement. We can only do this in limited circumstances, and we will give you 28 days' notice of any changes. |
| Property obligations | Your mortgage will be secured on the property (as described in the mortgage offer letter).<br>You will need to insure the property and keep it in a good state of repair (more details about this is contained in the legal mortgage).<br>Depending on the type of mortgage you have, there are limits on who can live in the property (more details about this are contained in the legal mortgage). |
| Joint borrowers | If you are borrowing with someone else, you are both jointly and individually responsible for the total loan amount plus interest and charges. This means that we can ask each of you individually for the full amount you owe us. |
| Flexible features | Your mortgage may include some flexible features, such as making overpayments and early repayment charges. If it does, these will be set out in your mortgage offer letter. |
| Transferring the mortgage | We may transfer our rights under your mortgage, as set out in the legal mortgage. |
| Buildings Insurance | As a condition of your mortgage, you are required to hold sufficient insurance which covers for the minimum reinstatement value of the property. Reinstatement value is the cost to rebuild the property plus additional fees such as clearing the site and other expenses. It is your responsibility to ensure that the cover you have selected sufficiently covers this, as you would be expected to pay any shortfall if that situation did occur. It is important to remember that as house prices rise, or you make any large improvements to the property you may need to revisit the cover amount for your building insurance and ensure it is still adequate.<br>If, at any time, we become aware that no cover or insufficient cover is in place we have the right to arrange a suitable policy cover and forward the costs to you. You may also be charged an administrative/handling fee for completing such service. Further details of this are set out in the legal mortgage. |
| Commission | We may pay the mortgage broker a commission for introducing you to us. The amount we pay them (if any) is set out in the mortgage offer letter. |

8.8 We may decrease the amount of a charge for any reason and at any time. If we do so, we will give you notice but may apply the decrease before notice is given to you.

8.9 We may also introduce new charges to enable us to recover an amount not exceeding our reasonable estimate of the administrative costs we expect to incur:

(a) in providing you with a new service or facility we make available to you in connection with our agreement; or

(b) in complying with new or changed legal or regulatory requirements which apply to our agreement.

We will give you not less than 28 days' written notice of any new charge which we introduce under this clause.

8.10 We reserve our rights to add amounts payable in the tariff of charges (as set out under clause 8.5) to the outstanding balance. You can contact us at any time to arrange payment of such amounts payable in the tariff of charges, if you wish to avoid increasing the outstanding balance or incurring interest on the amounts.

9.3 Early communication is essential, and our team is here to work with you to explore options and find a tailored solution that meets your individual and unique needs. If you fall behind on your monthly payments, it's important to act quickly. Contacting us early can help minimise any additional charges and prevent your situation from worsening. Please note that if your account falls into arrears, charges may apply as outlined in our tariff of charges. We will always provide a clear breakdown of any charges and explain what they mean for you.

9.4 We will ensure we take reasonable steps to contact you in the event of any payment shortfall, ensuring you are fully informed of your options and the potential implications of any missed payments.

9.5 In the event of default, moving directly into immediate repayment of the outstanding balance is something we will try to avoid. Instead, we will focus on understanding your circumstances and working with you to find a solution that considers your needs and offers the best opportunity to resolve your situation.

9.6 No matter what any other terms and conditions say, the outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable in each of the following events of default:

(a) if an amount equivalent to two or more monthly payments payable under your mortgage is in arrears;

(b) if you significantly or persistently breach any of the terms and conditions of the agreement and, if the breach is capable of remedy, you do not remedy the breach within 14 days of us giving you notice asking you to do so;

(c) if the title to the Property is defective in any way or your legal mortgage does not have first legal priority;

(d) if any part of the Property is compulsorily purchased (this means an order is issued by an official body, such as a council, stating that the Property must be purchased) or officially requisitioned (this means that the Property is seized by an official body against your will);

(e) if the value of the Property falls substantially because a building on it has been pulled down or damaged;

(f) if in our reasonable opinion, you have been involved in any serious criminal activity or any fraudulent activity;

(g) if you become bankrupt or make any formal arrangement relating to debts owed to other creditors;

(h) if we discover that any of the information given to us by you or by someone on your behalf before the legal mortgage was signed is wrong or that you knowingly failed to tell us something when you applied for any Loan and such information or failure to provide such information had or has a significant effect on our decision to lend or to continue to lend to you;

(i) if a mortgagee or other person interested in the Property takes proceedings for possession or otherwise to enforce their interest; or

(j) if you give possession of the Property to us or if, following reasonable investigation by us, we consider you have abandoned the Property.

10.2 We can make changes to the terms of our agreement without your consent for the following reasons:
