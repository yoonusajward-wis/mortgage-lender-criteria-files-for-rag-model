## Property

### Property Restrictions

#### The Society is willing to lend in the following instances:

* Converted Properties (where not mandatory licensed HMO)
* New build properties. This is provided that the build is in progress & subject to mortgage offer. If remortgaging, proof from the Land Registry will be required confirming that the property has been owned by the applicant(s) for at least 6 months.

#### The following are unacceptable:

* Properties where the applicant is also an owner occupier in the same building as the tenants (mix of ownership - rental & freehold)
* Properties with more than 4 bedrooms where let on a multiple occupancy basis
* Sale & rent back schemes
* New Build Properties bought off plan
* House in Multiple Occupancy (HMO) requiring Mandatory License
* Properties where the applicant(s) intend to reside now or in the future
* Holiday lets
* Sub letting
* Properties where any rent received is from a foreign source.

### Solar Panels/Wind Turbines/Biomass Boilers

The Society does not apply any restrictions in relation to any of the above.

### Tenancy Arrangements

Assured Shorthold Tenancy Agreements (ASTs) are acceptable or, if in Scotland, a Private Residential Tenancy is acceptable.

A maximum of 4 tenants is allowed. Where there is any element of multiple occupancy, the maximum number of bedrooms acceptable is 4. We do not accept mandatory licensed HMOs.

Where the tenants are students, professionals or there is any element of multi-occupancy the Landlord must be experienced (a minimum of 12 months experience is required).

Corporate Lets are acceptable for a maximum of 3 years. The Landlord must be experienced (minimum of 12 months experience), and no sub-letting is permitted.

Where a premium lease exists, this is not acceptable. The corporate body must be responsible for the rent and can only use the property for their own letting use and not sub let. We will not accept applicants purchasing property and then creating a tenancy agreement with a letting company, who subsequently sub let to tenants.

### Tenure

All flats and maisonettes must be leasehold (feuhold in Scotland) with a minimum unexpired term of 85 on completion of the mortgage.

Freehold flats where the borrower will also own a share in a management company that owns the freehold are acceptable.

Freehold flats are not acceptable. The only exception to this is the purchase of freehold flats in Scarborough. Tyneside flats where there are reciprocating lease / freehold arrangements are also acceptable.

Commonhold properties are not acceptable to lend on, by the Society.

### Unencumbered Property

If the property to be mortgaged is unencumbered then we may need to carry out additional checks to confirm the ownership of the property as part of the application process. This may include asking your client(s) to visit a local Skipton Building Society branch with suitable photo ID documentation or Skipton Building Society instructing a valuer to visit the property to carry out a standard valuation. 

The Underwriter will assess the case and advise you if any additional checks are required. We won't charge for a valuation for mortgage purposes where the property value is less than £1.5 million. If the property is worth more than this then your client(s) will be required to pay a top up fee. There may also be some additional travel fees for your client to pay if the property is off the mainland or in a remote location. 

If your client is capital raising against their unencumbered property then we would process this as a remortgage application and your client would be eligible for any product from our current remortgage range. Where the property is unencumbered it must have been owned for a minimum of 6 months.

### Valuation Fee Scale

[View our current Valuation Fee Scale](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/submitting-cases/fees/) for full details.

### Valuation Information

* We aim to instruct a valuation within 24 hours of the application being submitted. The type of valuation instructed will be the most suitable for the application, taking into consideration property type, LTV, etc and will be solely for the purposes of assessing the security property for mortgage purposes. This may be an AVM, Desktop or standard mortgage valuation.
* Connells act as the Society's panel managers and deal with maintenance of the panel together with the allocation of all instructions. A Panel Valuer that covers the security postcode area is always used
* Some products may qualify for a free valuation. This is up to a maximum purchase price/estimated valuation of £1,500,000. Please refer to the specific product details for further information, there may be some additional travel fees if the property is located off the mainland or in a remote location.
* A valuation instructed for Additional Borrowing purposes is free to the Customer, irrespective of the type of report obtained by the Society
* The minimum acceptable property value is £75,000
* Valuations are valid for 12 months from the date appearing on the valuation report or transcript report
* The Society does not accept re-type valuations except on Scottish cases, where a transcript is requested. If more than 3 months old, we will require a refresh before the transcript will be requested
* The Society will instruct a valuation for mortgage purposes only
* The Customer can request a RICS Home Survey Level 2 or a RICS Home Survey Level 3 but they would need to arrange this directly with Connells. Connells will provide a discount for cases proceeding with the Society, the customer should contact [Connells](tel:01525218655) (01525 218655) to benefit from this service. Your client needs to confirm their application is with Skipton Building Society and quote their mortgage application number, Skipton customers can expect to receive a minimum discount of 28%. Requesting a RICS home survey Level 2 or Level 3 will not delay the mortgage offer.

Standard Rate taxpayers

* 125% at the higher of; product rate plus 2%, or 5.5%

Where rent is being paid from a foreign source (i.e. not in £Sterling, IOM£ or Gibraltar£), it will not be used in the rental income calculation.

### Rental Types / Methods

All repayment types are acceptable. Interest Only is acceptable for the whole loan, with the sale of BTL property being the repayment vehicle. If interest only then maximum term is 25 years.

### Top Slicing

Where the interest coverage ratio (ICR) on the SBS security falls below 145%, we may consider the application where all the following conditions are met;

* Rental income cover is at least 110% at the higher of; product rate plus 2% or 5.5% (or at the higher of; product rate plus 1% or 5.5% if a fixed product of 5 years or more is required)
* Applicant's Income is £45k minimum (or £60k for joint applications)
* Background BTL portfolio rental income covers at least 135% @ 6%.

### TSM - Transfer Subject to Mortgage

On TSM's where the LTV is 65% or below the Society will assess the property using the original file valuation (index linked) supported by an AVM.

### Additional Borrowing

If your client has an existing mortgage with us and they want to borrow more, for example to carry out property improvements, then they can apply for an additional borrowing loan.

Additional Borrowing for business purposes or debt consolidation is not acceptable.

A minimum additional borrowing loan amount of £10,000 applies in most circumstances.

If the additional borrowing is for green home improvements (subject to product availability, 50%+ of the additional borrowing must be for green home improvements) then a minimum loan amount of £5,000 is acceptable.

Affordability is calculated on the total new loan amount, not just the additional borrowing.

Where funds are being requested for Green home improvements, quotes and estimates will be required to cover the full amount of the improvements.

Additional Borrowing is allowed up to a maximum LTV of 75%, the maximum LTV includes the current balance & the proposed additional loan.

Your client must have made six months' consecutive mortgage payments before applying for Additional Borrowing. Your client must not have had any mortgage or secured arrears in the last six months or have exceeded two missed months mortgage payments in the last two years.

To assess an Additional Borrowing application the following calculations will be used (irrespective of product selected):

**Higher rate taxpayers/Portfolio Landlords**

* 145% x the higher of; product rate plus 2% or 5.5%.

**Standard rate taxpayers**

* 125% x the higher of; product rate plus 2% or 5.5%.

You can submit an Additional Borrowing application for your client through [eMortgages](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/emortgages/), it's a single stage application process as a Decision In Principle (DIP) is not required.

### Capital Raising

Capital Raising is acceptable on Buy To Let remortgages up to 75% LTV for the following reasons:

* To repay an existing BTL mortgage secured on the property.
* Raising funds for home improvements to the security property.
* Raising funds to purchase another BTL property.
* Raising funds to purchase another residential property.
* To repay part of all of an existing residential mortgage.

### Deposit

Where a deposit is being used towards the purchase of the property we may ask for proof of deposit if we deem that necessary.

A Non-borrowing Occupier cannot provide or contribute to the deposit, they must be named on the mortgage.

Deposits from a non-UK source may be acceptable. We will require 6 months' bank statements detailing the original source of the funds and the transfer into the applicant's UK bank account together with a completed [International Deposit form](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria/a-z-lending-criteria/a-z-lending-criteria-btl) [PDF]. Please note, where the deposit originates from China, the maximum deposit acceptable from that source is £30,000.

If some or all the deposit is being gifted, full details must be provided at application stage before we make the decision to lend, please refer to Gifted Deposit for further details.

Vendor deposit funding, deposit funds raised through unsecured lending or deposit funds sourced from a child's savings account are not acceptable.

Where any of the circumstances surrounding the deposit do not meet our lending criteria requirements the application may be declined.

### Existing Portfolio Restrictions

* £3,000,000 BTL mortgages with SBS including any within the SBS Group.
* Maximum of 5 BTL properties with The Society whether held jointly or solely.
* Maximum of 10 properties in a portfolio. This includes any new/existing SBS BTL mortgages and regardless of whether unencumbered or mortgaged.

### Gifted Deposit

If some or all the funds being provided towards the purchase of the property are not being provided directly by the applicants and you are aware these are being provided as a gift, then full details must be disclosed when the application is submitted.

We do not accept gifted deposits from anyone who is or will be a Non-borrowing Occupier of the property to be mortgaged.

Gifted deposits from a non-UK source may be acceptable. We will require 6 months' bank statements detailing the original source of the funds and the transfer into the applicant's UK bank account together with a completed [International Deposit form](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria/a-z-lending-criteria/a-z-lending-criteria-btl) [PDF].

If the gifted deposit exceeds £500,000 additional documentation will be required, regardless of whether the gifted amount originated from a UK or a non-UK source.

For all gifted deposits the giftor providing the funds must be a relative of the applicant as defined by the Family Law Act 1996. A signed gifted deposit declaration is required from the giftor before completion. All giftors must be aged 18 years or over and cannot reside in the property.

Where any of the circumstances surrounding the deposit do not meet our lending criteria requirements the application may be declined.

### Let To Buy

If your client chooses to remortgage and rent out their current residential property to enable them to purchase a new residential property, relocate or move in with a partner/family member, then the following policy applies to the mortgage for the property to be let:

* 70% Maximum LTV
* 40 years maximum term, (25 years if any element of Interest Only)
* £20,000 gross minimum earned income (for joint applications, the main earner must have a gross minimum earned income of £20,000)
* tenancy agreement must be a minimum of 6 months
* if the mortgage on the property to be let is already with Skipton Building Society, then 'Consent to Let' must be applied for and accepted before a Decision in Principle is submitted.

When assessing the application we will use the following rental calculations:

**Higher rate taxpayers**

* 145% at the higher of; product rate plus 2% or 5.5% (or at the higher of; product rate plus 1% or 5.5% if taking a fixed rate product of 5+ years).

**Standard rate taxpayers**

#### Let to Buy: Onward Residential Purchase

This will be the applicants' main residence after their existing residential property has been converted to a BTL. If the onward purchase is to be mortgaged with Skipton Building Society then the following policy applies:

* 95% Maximum LTV
* where the applicant is raising funds from a mortgage elsewhere for the deposit, details of the mortgage must be provided prior to the offer of the new Skipton Building Society residential mortgage
* where the mortgage for the property to be let is to be held with another lender, evidence of the projected rental income is required. The Underwriter may request a rental assessment letter from an ARLA agent (Association of Residential Letting Agents) if they feel this is required. If the security LTV is >75% then the rental income must meet the Society's calculation of 125% @ 6%. This applies at both the individual property and portfolio level. Any shortfall will be taken as an outgoing.

### Max Loan Amount

Max Loan Amount is £1.5 million

### Loan To Value (LTV)

* Listing of the development/building within the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) database (accessed by Skipton).
* Leaseholder Deed of Certificate* or Landlord Certificate* confirming qualifying Leaseholder status.
* EWS1 form with the ratings A1, A2 or B1. Where the rating is A3 or B2, the development/building must be listed within the MHCLG database. Where the property is in Scotland, ratings A3 and B2 are unacceptable.
* Confirmation from the Builder/Developer any cladding remediation costs will not be passed to the customer.

*Please note: Where a Leaseholder Deed of Certificate, qualifying Leaseholder status, or a Landlord Certificate is provided for a remortgage application, the Society's Fee Assisted Conveyancing service cannot be chosen due to the conveyancing requirements.

### Flats - Buy to Let

Flats are acceptable for BTL purposes as per our policy outlined below:

Please note, our policy on flats does not restrict based on storey height or number of units in a block but, where storey height exceeds 5 floors, access to a lift is required.

* Maximum LTV is 75%.
* Minimum property value/purchase price (whichever is lower) is £75,000.
* Non-standard flats (above commercial, deck access, mezzanine flats, studio, ex-local authority) are acceptable for Buy to Let. The minimum property value required is £100,000 outside the M25 or £200,000 within the M25.
* Overall exposure in any development typically limited to 20%.
* Re-enforced in situ concrete with brick render is considered a standard construction for flats and is acceptable to the Society.
* Minimum floor space of 30 square metres for all flats is required.

For flats within commercial/retail outlets a standard valuation will be carried out and the decision to lend will be made on whether the valuer recommends we proceed. The recommendation will be subject to the valuer believing the property is suitable security for a mortgage and will be easily re-saleable. The valuer's decision is final: no challenges will be accepted, and no refunds of valuations fees will be issued if the decision is a decline.

### Ground Rent and Service Charges

Ground rent and other service charges must always remain at a reasonable level during the lease term. The ground rent must not exceed more than 0.1% of the property value/purchase price (whichever is lower) at the time of the application and there must be a minimum period of 10 years between any ground rent increases.

It is acceptable if the ground rent escalation is linked to the Retail Price Index (RPI) or other similar index. Compounded PRI increases are not acceptable.

Clauses providing for ground rent increases that 'double' (or more) the preceding level are not acceptable.

A ground rent clause which allows the ground rent charge to exceed £250 p.a. outside the M25 or exceed £1,000 p.a. inside the M25 is not acceptable unless a deed of lease variation can be obtained. If this isn't possible then we can consider accepting a suitable indemnity insurance policy to protect our interests.

### New Build

Any property being sold for occupation for the first time which has been newly built or converted within the last 3 calendar years will be defined as a New Build property.

* New Build Homes are acceptable providing the build is completed within 12 months of the Societies 1st mortgage offer.
* Properties bought off plan are not acceptable for BTL applications.
* We accept BTL applications up to 75%* LTV for New Build properties.

*If Incentives apply the maximum LTV may be reduced, please refer to New Build Incentives for more details.

### New Build - Building Certificates

For properties built within the last 10 years, a suitable certificate/guarantee must be available. The following new home warranty schemes are acceptable:

* ABC+
* Advantage
* Aedis Warranties Limited (HomeProof)
* Ark Insurance Group Limited
* BLP (Building Life Plans)
* Build Assure/FMB Insurance
* Build Zone
* CADIS
* Castle 10
* Checkmate
* Global Home Warranties Limited
* International Construction Warranties (ICW)
* LABC
* NHBC
* One Guarantee
* Premier Guarantee
* Protek
* The Q Policy for Residential Properties, Bespoke Properties & Completed Properties
* Thomas Miller Specialist Construction.

If the property does not have the benefit of a new home warranty scheme, we require a Professional Consultant Certificate. Where a Professional Consultant's Certificate is accepted in place of a new home warranty scheme, these are only acceptable on small scale developments i.e. those consisting of 15 residential units or less (either houses or residential flats).

### New Build Incentives

Builders may offer sales incentives to potential buyers to encourage them to purchase their property. An incentive is anything the builder gives or provides to the buyer in cash or goods. Typical examples are deposits (i.e. builders deposits) paid before completion and cash paid after completion - often to pay stamp duty or legal fees. As all incentives must be paid for by the builder, they can be regarded as a less transparent alternative to reducing the sale price.

#### Assessment of Incentives

Financial incentives of up to 5% of the purchase price or valuation (whichever is the lower) are allowed on New Build properties only and are permitted on any New Build. Any application where the financial incentive value exceeds 5% will be declined, regardless of the LTV.

Where there is a financial incentive on a BTL application the maximum LTV available will be reduced by 5% to 70% LTV.

The Customer must be able to provide a minimum of a 5% deposit (a builder deposit can be accepted in addition to this but not in place of the customer's own deposit).

#### Evidence

All incentives must be declared at DIP stage. The UK Finance Disclosure of Incentives form (formally CML incentive form) is required by the valuer, which provides details and value of any incentives. Valuers take incentives into account when preparing the valuation report. Please note that all lending is always subject to a satisfactory valuation for mortgage purposes. We will work off the lower of the valuation or the purchase price. Evidence of the deposit may be requested at application stage.

The Society does not accept applications where:

* The builders/vendors are paying above market value for a part exchange property.
* The application has any form of Vendor (Private Seller) deposit funding.
