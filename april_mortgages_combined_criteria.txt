# SECTION 1 – OVERVIEW

April Mortgages offers residential mortgages with a unique combination of peace of mind and freedom. We think mortgages should be simple, which is why we've designed all our products to give you **certainty** and **flexibility**, with clever features that put you in control.

## Key Features

* **5-15 year fixed rates** - Lock in your monthly payments for longer, giving you peace of mind and protection from rising rates
* **Automatically reducing interest rate** - Your mortgage rate automatically reduces as you pay down your loan. Because the more you have paid off, the lower our risk is. We want to reward you for that - and this could save you thousands of pounds over the years
* **No Early Repayment Charges** - We don't think a mortgage should ever tie you down, which is why we don't have an Early Repayment Charge if you sell your home or repay the loan from your own funds (when moving house, regular overpayments, lump sums or redeeming in full using own funds)
* **Up to 7x income** - We'll lend up to 7x your income, helping more people access the homes they want, with the confidence they need
* **Uncapped overpayments** - Make overpayments without limits
* **Portable mortgages** - Keep your mortgage when you move home

# SECTION 40 – STANDARD VARIABLE RATE (SVR)

At the end of the fixed-rate product, our Standard Variable Rate (SVR) will apply. Unlike other lenders, our SVR is priced according to risk and the lower the LTV, the lower the rate will be. Our SVR uses the same LTV bands as our fixed rate products and, as the LTV reduces over time, the SVR automatically moves to a new lower rate as it passes into a new LTV band.

However, an SVR should rarely be a first choice and we will offer your client the same great deals we offer to new clients. We always make sure you are involved in this process and will proactively contact you at the same time as your client in advance of the fixed rate ending.

---

# SECTION 41 – BROKER PARTNERSHIP

We believe in building long-term relationships, with our broker partners and with our customers. That's why we only distribute through intermediaries and work closely with you to ensure you receive the same great service as your clients and are fairly rewarded for your expertise.

We'll work closely with you throughout the term of your client's mortgage. From arranging the mortgage to further advances and product switches. At the end of their product term we will proactively contact you at the same time we contact your client. And we'll offer them the same great rates we offer to new borrowers.
