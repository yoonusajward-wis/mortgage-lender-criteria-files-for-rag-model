 Our standard acceptability 6 Criteria definition: Indicates if we can potentially consider borrowers who have had an IVA and if so how many years ago it must have been registered. An IVA is registered when a payment plan is agreed with the creditors. For example, a home buyer is looking to obtain a mortgage to fund a house purchase but entered into an IVA 6 years ago which consisted of a 5-year plan to repay the agreed amount to their creditors. The plan was successfully completed without any unsatisfactory conduct so their IVA has now been satisfied for 1 year and was registered 6 years ago . IMPORTANT NOTE: An IVA usually stays on the credit file for 6 years from the date it was REGISTERED not from the date it was satisfied which typically occurs 5 years after the date the IVA was entered into (the registered date). Our policy notes: We will look at satisfied IVAs only three years from when they are satisfied. Last updated: 20 April 2017
