# SECTION 1 – RESIDENTIAL LENDING CRITERIA

## Acceptable tenure

### Scotland

  * Simple/Absolute
* Commonhold

### England, Wales & Northern Ireland

  * Freehold
  * Commonhold
  * All leasehold properties require a **minimum of 85 years** at the start of the mortgage term.

## Adverse credit

**Not Acceptable (ever):** Bankruptcy; IVA; previous property taken into possession or voluntary surrender to lender.

**Not Acceptable (last 3 years):** CCJ registered or settled in this period, or outstanding CCJ outside 3 years; any arrears on mortgage, fixed payment loan and/or rent; more than two consecutive missed payments on credit/store cards. We will not usually lend if applicant has defaulted or settled a past defaulted account in the last 3 years, or has an outstanding default.

Communications and mail order records can be ignored, unless the scale and/or frequency of missed payments indicate cause for concern.

## Affordability

As part of our underwriting process we must assess the applicant's income, credit commitments and cost of living expenses to ensure their ability to pay.

We need confirmation of the applicant's committed expenditure including credit cards, overdraft, loans, hire purchase, maintenance, school fees and child care. General household expenditure, for example food and utilities, are automatically accounted for in our affordability calculator.

Any mortgage (other than a formal Buy to Let mortgage) must be included in our affordability calculator.

**To do this, you'll need to:**

  1. calculate the cost of interest on the non redeemed balance at a nominal rate of 7.30%
2. enter the monthly equivalent cost in the monthly outgoings field of our [affordability calculator](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/calculators/affordability-calculator/).

Applicants obtaining 'consent to let' or a 'let to buy' loan must include this mortgage in the affordability assessment unless they can provide evidence of a mortgage offer which proves that the retained property is being remortgaged into a formal Buy to Let.

You can [use our affordability calculator](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/calculators/affordability-calculator/) to estimate what your client may be able to borrow based on their income and financial commitments.

**Our Bespoke range:**

For clients that need an individual approach to their outgoings, we can consider as an example:

  * Offsetting school fees/childcare if proof of ringfenced funds can be provided
  * Offsetting existing and new Consent to Let (CTL) mortgages subject to an ARLA member (The Association of Residential Letting Agents) confirming the expected rental for the property and this estimates rental meeting our standard BTL assessment.

## Age of applicant

**Minimum (Residential):** 18.
**Maximum (Residential – Standard):** 75 years (eldest applicant) at end of mortgage term.
**Maximum (Residential – Bespoke):** 80 years (eldest applicant) at end of term; remains 75 for Interest Only and Part & Part. 

## Back to Back transactions

* A 'Back to Back' transaction, where a property has been owned for less than 6 months, is not acceptable and will be declined.
  * Assignable contracts are not acceptable and will be declined.

## Bespoke

**Check our 5 golden rules**

  * Must pass our credit score
  * Must meet our minimum income and loan size requirements*
  * Income to support the loan must be paid in GBP
  * Up to 90% LTV for Residential and up to 75% LTV for Buy to Let 
  * Must meet our standard property criteria.

For further information, take a look at our [Bespoke information](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/residential/bespoke-mortgages/) page to see how we can meet the needs of your clients with complex income.

*The minimum loan size is Â£150,000 and the minimum income requirements are:
**Residential:** Repayment mortgage - At least one applicant must earn Â£40,000. Interest only mortgage - Â£50,000 for sole applicants and Â£75,000 for joint applicants. 

## Builder incentives

Builders' incentives are accepted up to 5% of purchase price with no adjustment to the purchase price or loan. We don't accept guaranteed rental income schemes.

## Bespoke Green New Build mortgages

Green New Build mortgages are available for properties with energy performance (EPC) ratings A or B.

Please check the EPC to make sure the property is eligible before submitting an application. This can be checked via the [UK Government website](https://www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate) or the [Scottish EPC Register](https://www.scottishepcregister.org.uk/) for Scottish properties.

## Capital raising

Applicants can remortgage to raise additional capital up to 85% LTV (excluding fees) or 75% if there is any element of debt consolidation.

Applicants can borrow funds to raise additional capital to fund most legal purposes, provided the capital is not used for;

  * business or speculative purposes (e.g. investment, replacing savings)
  * payment of tax
  * gambling debts
  * a timeshare
  * payment of care fees

Applicants can remortgage up to 90% LTV on a like for like basis or if they're repaying a Help to Buy loan in full, purchasing the final staircase on shared ownership or buying out someone from the title of the property (Transfer of Equity).

Remortgages where the applicant has owned the property for less than 6 months are not normally acceptable. There are some circumstances where we can consider these applications (such as when an applicant has inherited the property or where a developer has taken the property as part exchange) so please [contact us](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/contact-us/) to provide details.

## Concessionary purchase price

We'll base our lending on the lower of the purchase price or value, except where the discount is at least 25% of the mortgage valuation. In these circumstances we'll exclusively use the valuation figure.

## Conflict of interest policy

We won't accept any applications where the broker has a financial interest in the property being mortgaged. Put simply, the broker submitting the case can't also be the buyer/owner.

## Contractors

The term contractors covers contractors trading as self employed, limited companies and contractors working through an umbrella firm. Contractors have the option to apply as self employed, requiring 3 years trading and 2 years income figures, or as employment type contractor.

**If your applicant falls outside of the minimum income, 80% contract value or minimum 12 months contracting period, please [contact us](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/contact-us/) and we may be able to help with our Bespoke range.**

For contractors applying as employed, we require:

  * Maximum 90% LTV, exclusive of fees
  * Applicants must have a minimum gross contracting income of Â£50,000pa for the contractor (not the household)
  * Affordability is based on 80% of gross contract income
  * Minimum contracting period is 12 months in current occupation. The contract does not have to be with the same agency/employer
  * Current contract is required for income assessment. This can be either the original or a certified copy. We'll also need copies of all other contracts held in the past 12 months
  * We'll not accept contractors who have had cumulative contract gaps of 1 month or more in the last 12 months
  * Eligible for Interest Only, subject to our interest only lending criteria
* Where contractors use an umbrella company to manage their payroll, please refer to our [umbrella companies income criteria](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/lending-criteria/#income-resi)
* We won't lend to Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) contract workers under our contractor criteria. But we will consider them under our [self employed income criteria](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/lending-criteria/#income-resi).

## Criminal record

We will not normally accept applications from applicants with a criminal record unless the conviction is for a minor traffic offence, or is spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.

## Diplomatic status

Applicants with diplomatic status in the UK are not acceptable.

## Direct Debits

Payment by Direct Debit mandate is compulsory for all loan types.

## Debt to income

When assessing applications, we consider the level of debts the customer(s) is committed to relative to their income, how much they've paid off and the credit they have left available. We'll exclude student debt from our assessment.

## Dependant relative

Applications for the purchase of residential properties that will be occupied by a dependant relative of the applicant are not acceptable.

If the property being purchased is being sold by a dependant relative who will then remain in the property after the sale takes place, the application will be declined.

## Deposit

Proof of deposit may be requested at our underwriter's discretion.

**Allowed (deposit sources):** Equity from sale of property; savings; family gift; inheritance; capital raising on another property; Forces Help to Buy.

**Not Acceptable (deposit sources):** Personal loans; funding from credit cards; income from cryptocurrency trading; vendor/builder cashback without additional minimum deposit from an acceptable source.

## Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)

**For residential purchases (including private or through an estate agent):** an EPC must be provided (unless the property is registered on the [PRS Exemptions Register](https://prsregister.beis.gov.uk/NdsBeisUi/register-search-exemptions)). Currently there's no minimum rating requirement for residential properties.

**For remortgages:** properties may not have an EPC if they were owned prior to the introduction of these regulations or if the EPC has expired. This is acceptable, and a new EPC will not be required in such cases.

**Valuation Reports:** For residential purchases, the valuer, where available, will supply the EPC rating within the valuation report.

**New Build Properties:** When a new build is under construction and doesn't have an EPC rating, please provide a Predicted Energy Assessment (PEA). We'll ask the solicitor to confirm the EPC rating before the mortgage starts.

You can find the EPC rating of a property registered in England and Wales on the [UK Government's website](https://www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate) and for properties registered in Scotland you can find this on the [Scottish Energy Performance Certificate website](https://www.scottishepcregister.org.uk/).

## First Start

**A sponsor is a close relative, normally a parent or step parent of any applicant, who is added as a co-borrower.**

[**First Start products**](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/new-business-products/?ProductType=First+Start&ProductTerm=null&ProductCategory=null&ProductLTV=null&InterestOnly=false) are available up to 95% LTV (including fees). Subject to meeting the following criteria:

  * Maximum loan of Â£500,000 (including fees)
  * Maximum of 4 applicants (however, only the income of the sponsor and the highest earning applicant will be assessed)
* The sponsor's minimum assessable income must be at least Â£30,000
  * The highest earning applicant must have a minimum assessable income of at least Â£20,000
  * Maximum age for sponsor at application is 60, and must not exceed 80 years old at the end of term
  * Where term extends into retirement please refer to our Lending into Retirement criteria
  * Purchases only
  * Repayment only
  * The sponsor must be a residential owner occupier living in the UK
  * The monthly payments need to come from 1 account
* Applicants cannot own any other property at the time of completion. This doesn't apply to the sponsor whose mortgage commitments are included in the affordability assessment.

You can choose if the property is owned by the applicant(s) only or jointly by the applicant(s) and the sponsor. If the property to be owned is in the name of the applicant(s) only, then the sponsor, as a condition of the mortgage Offer, must receive independent legal advice in respect of the transaction before completion.

The sponsor and applicant(s) are jointly and individually liable for the total mortgage.

See how much your client could borrow using our [First Start Calculator](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/calculators/first-start-calculator/).

## Forces Help to Buy & Long Service Advance of Pay (LSAP)

  * Funds from this scheme are an acceptable source of deposit. The monthly repayment must be included in the affordability calculation as a commitment.
* For first purchases a copy of the Personal Information Note supplied to the applicant will be required to evidence deposit. For movers or remortgages the applicant's payslip will be required to evidence the monthly loan outgoing.
  * For applicants who hold a Long Service Advance of Pay (LSAP), the payment must be included as an outgoing in the affordability calculation if continuing after completion.
  * Forces Help to Buy cannot be used as a deposit on 95% LTV products or in conjunction with any other Help to Buy scheme
* Applicants using FHTB can't have an interest in any other property.

## Fire risk assessments

Where the valuer identifies a flat with potentially combustible cladding and/or stacked balconies which could facilitate the spread of fire, we'll require the Fire Risk Assessment report (FRA) and Fire Risk Assessment External Walls (FRAEW), together with the names and qualifications of the authors of these documents, for the building. Once we have all of this information, our Property Risk team will assess and advise if acceptable to proceed.

We do not accept EWS1 forms for properties with cladding/stacked balconies.

Please refer to our [fire risk assessments criteria](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/lending-criteria/#fire-risk-assessments) for acceptable qualifications for FRA & FRAEW reports.

All properties 10 storeys or higher must be referred to our Property Risk Team prior to application. Please [contact us](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/contact-us/).

## Foreign Nationals

We require confirmation that the applicant has the right to live and work in the UK. The applicant will need to have resided in the UK for long enough to ensure we have a meaningful credit score and employment history, this is normally a minimum of 3 years.

**The following applicants can apply up to our maximum LTV:**

  * Irish Nationals.
* EU, EEA and Swiss Nationals with 'settled status'.

  * Second applicants on a dependent visa may be acceptable, subject to one applicant holding one of the above visas
  * The underwriter will need to be satisfied that there is an adequate period of time remaining on the visa to warrant granting a long term loan. Where the applicant doesn't have a settled status, you should include details of your client's long term plans.

  * business or speculative purposes (raising capital to fund a deposit or outright purchase of a Buy to Let is not considered a business purpose)
  * payment of tax
  * gambling debts
  * a timeshare. 

Debt consolidation loans can be considered subject to a maximum 75% LTV and individual assessment by our underwriters. A solicitor may occasionally be required to act. You can use our [Solicitor Search tool](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/find-a-solicitor/) to find which firms are already on our approved panel.

**Repayment options:** Standard further advance: capital and interest only. Bespoke further advance: Capital Repayment, Interest Only, or combination; Interest Only subject to Repayment Strategy and [Interest Only criteria](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/lending-criteria/interest-only-resi/).

**Valuation of property** - loans less than Â£20,000 with a total LTV less than 75% (based on a house price index) may not require a physical valuation of the property. Anything other than this will need a property revaluation (see fee scale below). Where the last recorded Bank of Ireland UK panel valuation was more than 10 years ago, a standard valuation will be required. Please refer to our standard valuation fees. This will be assessed upon application. 

**Revaluation fee scale:** £0–£125,000: £110. £125,001–£300,000: £150. £300,001–£600,000: £220. £600,001–£1,000,000: £300. £1,000,001–£1,600,000: £400. £1,600,001 and above: by negotiation.

## Home improvements

**Remortgage with Capital Raising for home improvements**

The underwriter will confirm what is specifically required once they've initially assessed the case. They may request:

* Builders' quotes

We may ask the conveyancer to ensure appropriate Local Authority Building Regulations are followed and Planning Consents have been obtained where they are required to do so as part of the work.

You should ensure that all appropriate warranties and certificates are available and that the Buildings Insurer is aware and approves the works being undertaken.

**Remortgage for property where previous works had been carried out**

As part of the property assessment, we may ask if any property works have been carried out with Local Authority Building Regulations and Planning Permission Approval.

If the above does occur, our underwriters will add condition(s) to our Mortgage Offer, asking for your conveyancer to confirm all mandatory required regulations and consents have been granted.

## Inter family sales

## Interest only

* You can borrow up to 60% LTV on an interest only basis. We'll also consider up to 75% LTV if the amount you want over 60% is on a repayment basis
* A minimum of Â£250,000 equity is required in the mortgaged property where 'Sale of mortgaged property' is chosen as the intended repayment strategy

**For existing customers moving home:**
For porting and moving applications a minimum household income of Â£20,000 per annum is required.

**We will verify income on every application. Income must be paid and contracted in GBP (Â£) and be subject to UK tax and National Insurance contributions.**

### Employed

We will normally use 100% of contractually guaranteed income. The inclusion of non-guaranteed income (such as bonuses or regular commission) can be considered up to 50%. For non-guaranteed income to be considered we would need to evidence a track record of it being received and satisfy ourselves that it will be ongoing and sustainable.

Our underwriters have some discretion to use a different proportion of variable earnings but a historic record of these earnings will normally be required in order to exceed 50%, typically 3 years.

We'll take into consideration employment type and sector when considering ongoing sustainability.

We'll assess the latest P60 and the year to date income and will normally use the lowest figure.

If variable earnings are high we may ask for further documentation to evidence track record and future sustainability.

For bonus payments, we'll require evidence of the actual bonus paid.

Share awards, for example Restricted Stock Units will not be considered as bonuses and therefore cannot be used as variable income.

**New employment:**
To consider income from a new role we would need:
  * The new position to be in the same line of employment as current role
  * Proof of new position and salary via the new job offer or accepted contract
  * We may condition the offer of loan for receipt of the first payslip to confirm the applicant has started the new employment before we release the funds.

**Confirmed pay rise:**
* We'll consider using income from a future pay rise subject to confirmation from the employer (such as a reference or pay rise notification).
* We may request proof that the pay rise has taken effect where we can't adequately confirm the salary increase.

**Bonus, commission, and other additional payments:**
* We can include non-guaranteed income in the affordability assessment, such as bonuses, overtime or commission up to a maximum of 100%, where it's considered sustainable and a track record of the payments can be established at the level being used.

### Self Employed

Our standard proof of income requirement is the latest 2 years' SA302s supported by the latest 2 years' Tax Year Overviews and the latest month's business bank statement. Self employed applicants must have been trading for a minimum of 3 years but only the last 2 years' figures will be used. We'll request their latest business bank statement to evidence recent trading activity. We may request additional documentation to support our underwriting assessment, including cases where applicants haven't restarted trading yet.

Contractors can continue to apply as self employed under existing criteria, or as a contractor. Details of the contractor criteria can be found under Contractors.

For our **Bespoke range**, underwriters have the discretion to use other forms of self employed income which wouldn't be visible from tax return data (SA302/Tax overview). Examples include:
  * Utilisation of entitlement to net profit after tax
  * Adding back of one off exceptional items
* Using the latest year's income in isolation
  * Dividend income of shareholders holding less than 25%
  * Clients who have recently changed their status to self employed in the same occupation or have bought (or are buying into) a going concern.

**Directors with a shareholding of 25% or greater:**
We normally use the latest years' director's salary, plus an average of the latest 2 years' dividends or the most recent year if lower.

**Equity Partners:**
Equity partners of large partnerships (typically Solicitors & Accountants) will be treated as self employed, irrespective of their shareholding. Therefore, to verify income, we'll require the latest two years' SA302's and corresponding Tax Year Overviews.

For newly appointed partners, or those with less than 2 years partnership, confirmation of income can be obtained from the Finance/Senior Partner or firm's accountant.

In these situations, we'll require the letter to confirm previous and expected earnings, as well as the previous P60 to evidence the level of income the applicant was earning before becoming an equity partner.

We'll require the applicant's latest month's personal bank statement and these must show income from the partnership.

### Other Income Types

**Pension income:**
Pension income may be used to support a mortgage advance, as long as it can be fully verified and guaranteed for life.

**Maintenance Income:**
We will accept up to 100% of child maintenance income. However it cannot be the only form of income on an application.

Any children associated with the maintenance payments should be entered as financial dependents.

To verify income we'll need the latest 3 months' bank statements showing receipt of payments on all cases.

We'll also need 1 of the following:
* a copy of a Court Order
* Maintenance Assessment letter from the Child Support Agency
* a written private agreement drawn up between the separating parties.

If any payment has been missed in that period, then the income cannot be used as part of the affordability assessment.

**Second jobs:**
We can consider using income from applicants with second jobs. The applicant must have held the 2 positions for at least 12 months.

Second incomes do not need to be in the same line of employment. Our underwriters will assess whether the income quality is adequate and if so, it will be included within the assessable income.

**Fixed term contracts:**
Fixed term contracts are treated on merit and in context of each individual case. If the income is to be used in our assessment of affordability we would typically want the applicant to be able to demonstrate:
  * Evidence of previous contract renewal
  * Not all the income is dependent on a fixed term contract, for example a joint application with 1 applicant on a fixed term contract
  * A sufficient remaining period on the contract to warrant the approval of a long term loan.

**Investment or rental income:**
Investment income is not acceptable.

Rental income will not normally be considered as allowable income unless it can be treated as an ongoing business, and criteria for self-employed applicants will apply.

Income generated from land and property will be calculated by deducting the total amount of 'relief for finance costs' from the 'taxable profit for the year' (in line with current tax calculation requirements).

**Benefit income:**
We will not normally include income derived from benefits as part of our income and affordability assessments.

**Employment in a family business:**
We can consider applications from applicants employed by their family on merit of each individual case. We may request additional supporting information.

**Foster income:**
Applicants must have a minimum of 2 years' fostering income.

We accept pitched roofs covered with thatch, slates or standard/artificial tiles. Thatched roofs must have specialist insurance cover in place.

**100% Flat Roofs**

Houses with 100% flat roofs may be acceptable if the property is of traditional construction and the valuer confirms saleability and acceptability to other lenders.

For semi-detached and terraced houses, party walls must extend above the flat roof covering between the properties for the property to be acceptable to us.

100% flat roofs on blocks of flats/apartments are generally acceptable.

For applicants who do not meet this standard residency period, please refer to the [Foreign Nationals](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/lending-criteria/foreign-nationals/) section for guidance on rights to live and work in the UK.

For good quality clients who don't meet the above requirements, we may still be able to help through our **Bespoke range**. Please [contact us](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/contact-us/) to discuss the case.

## Scotland

In Scotland, if it is public knowledge a property is for sale, the seller in most cases must provide a Home Report to prospective buyers. There are some exceptional situations when a seller can choose not to provide a potential purchaser with the Home Report and cases where a Home Report is not actually required. Further information can be found at https://www.mygov.scot/buying-a-home/home-report

For applications where no Home Report is required or available, we'll instruct a mortgage valuation.

The Home Report contains the Property Questionnaire, Single Survey, and an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC); the majority will also contain a Generic Mortgage Valuation Report (GMVR).

For purchase applications we'll request a transcript of the GMVR from the valuer who prepared the original Home Report. That valuer must be on the Bank of Ireland Panel. We'll only accept transcripts from Home Reports that are no more than 12 weeks old. It is the seller's responsibility to obtain a refreshed Home Report if this is older than 12 weeks.

The transcript we receive is valid throughout the offer period and a Home Report refresh is not required. If the offer expires and an offer extension is required, then we'll require a revaluation which the applicant must pay for.

To get the correct product and Loan to Value (where the purchase price is different from the Home Report) you should key the application with the lower of the valuation or purchase price and then in the additional information box put a note on to say what the correct purchase price is. The application must also include the name of the firm that completed the Home Report and the date when the Home Report was undertaken.

If the firm is on our panel and the Home Report in date, then a transcript can be instructed.

If the firm is not on panel, then a Standard valuation would be required, but if the product does not include a fees free valuation or the fees free valuation has already been used, then a valuation fee payment must be taken first.

Missives covers the exchange of correspondence between the purchaser's and seller's solicitors negotiating the conditions of the sale. Property transactions in Scotland become legally binding for all parties upon 'conclusion of Missives'.

**Scottish Private Residential Tenancies (PRT)**

Scottish Private Residential Tenancies (PRT) are acceptable and we'll instruct a mortgage valuation.

**Tenure**

Tenure - typically referred to as Former Feudal, Simple/Absolute ownership is accepted.

Applications can be considered for security on the following Scottish Islands; Lewis and Harris, Mainland Shetland, Mainland Orkney, Skye, Bute, Arran, Islay, Mull, Whalsay, Yell, South Ronaldsay, West Burra, Tiree and Unst.

Where the valuer identifies a flat with potentially combustible cladding and/or stacked balconies which could facilitate the spread of fire, we'll require the Fire Risk Assessment report (FRA) and Fire Risk Assessment External Walls (FRAEW), together with the names and qualifications of the authors of these documents, for the building. Once we have all of this information, our Property Risk team will assess and advise if acceptable to proceed.

We do not accept EWS1 forms for properties with cladding/stacked balconies.

Please refer to our [fire risk assessments criteria](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/lending-criteria/#fire-risk-assessments) for acceptable qualifications for FRA & FRAEW reports.

All properties 10 storeys or higher must be referred to our Property Risk Team prior to application. Please [contact us](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/contact-us/).

### England, Wales & Northern Ireland

## Age of applicant

**Minimum (BTL):** 21. **Maximum (BTL):** 80 years (eldest applicant) at end of mortgage term.

## Affordability

As part of our underwriting process we must assess the applicant's income, credit commitments and cost of living expenses to ensure their ability to pay.

We offer several affordability assessment methods for Buy to Let mortgages:

### Top Slicing

We'll assess affordability using the applicant's personal income. This can be used to cover a rent shortfall to achieve 145% of the monthly interest due (inclusive of any product fees added to the loan).

We'll look at your customer's overall affordability including their credit commitments, residential mortgage and existing Buy to Let properties.

**Rental calculation:** Rental income must be at least 100% of the monthly interest due, inclusive of any product fees added to the loan. **Stress rate (Top Slicing):** Fixed &lt;5 years or variable: higher of 5.5% or pay rate + 2%; Fixed 5 years or more: higher of 4.5% or pay rate + 1%. Proof of income will be required once full application is submitted.

### Bespoke

Bespoke Buy to Let (BTL) is a personal income supported BTL proposition for landlords allowing larger loan lending, and using applicants' personal income within the affordability assessment where the Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) falls below the minimum requirements.

Bespoke BTL varies from our existing BTL Top Slicing proposition by allowing larger loan sizes (up to Â£1.5m) and a broader range of applicant types.

Monthly rent is not to be less than 100% of the monthly interest when calculated at the stress rate, with a minimum ICR of 145%, including available personal non-rent income.

Cases where rental income fits on a 145% ICR basis but require another area of Bespoke BTL criteria are acceptable, subject to full income verification.

**Stress rate (Bespoke BTL):** Fixed &lt;5 years or variable: higher of 5.5% or pay rate + 2%. Fixed 5 years or more: higher of 4.5% or pay rate + 1%. Income assessment in line with Bespoke Residential criteria. For more information, please visit our residential income criteria.

### Income Cover Ratio (ICR)

There's no minimum income required.

**Rental calculation:**

Rental income must be at least 145% of the monthly interest due, inclusive of any product fees added to the loan. **Stress rate (ICR):** Fixed &lt;5 years or variable: higher of 5.5% or pay rate + 2%. Fixed 5 years or more: higher of 4.5% or pay rate + 1%.

## Back to Back transactions

We require applicants to have owned the property for a minimum of 6 months prior to completion of this transaction.

**Purchase**

We require the vendor to have owned the property for a minimum of 6 months prior to completion of this transaction unless the seller is:

* a personal representative of the registered proprietor; or
* an institutional mortgagee exercising its power of sale; or
* a receiver, trustee-in-bankruptcy or liquidator; or
* a developer or builder selling a property acquired under a part-exchange scheme; or
* a registered housing provider (Housing Association) exercising a power of sale.

## Let to Buy

Remortgage of a current residential to a Buy to Let and capital raising to fund the purchase of the new main residence is acceptable. To be acceptable we need to be satisfied that the applicant will be moving out of the property upon completion and moving into their new residence, otherwise it will become a regulated Buy to Let. It must be a simultaneous completion.

We'll require confirmation of the new correspondence address, purchase price, borrowing amount, monthly payment, a breakdown of how funds are being used e.g. deposit, fees, improvements etc. and a copy of the onward residential mortgage offer if applicable. If there isn't a mortgage the solicitor must confirm the details.

We do not allow capital raising for any debt consolidation. We can accept both standalone Let to Buy applications and where we're also providing the mortgage for the onward residential purchase.

All Let to Buy properties will require a valid Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) with a rating between A-E (unless exempt) or between A-D in Scotland. This must be in place at the time the valuation is carried out, if not, additional costs may be incurred and the application may be delayed.

## Legal fees for remortgages

**Remortgages with standard legal fees paid**

Some of our remortgage products include standard legal fees. This means we cover the basic legal costs. For these products, your client must use the legal firm assigned by our partner, Legal Marketing Services Ltd (LMS).

**Applicants wishing to use their own solicitor**

If your client prefers to use their own solicitor, they must select a remortgage product without standard legal fees paid. In this case, they are responsible for all legal costs and disbursements.

**Important exclusions**

**Help to Buy** and **Shared Ownership** remortgages are not eligible for fees-assisted products. Your client will need to choose a product without standard legal fees paid and choose a solicitor, ideally from our approved panel.

**What we don't cover**

We won't pay for additional legal work outside the scope of a standard remortgage transaction. The following costs are examples of fees which won't be paid by us:

* Further valuation reports
* Related legal services
* Transfer of Equity
* Deed of Postponement
* Deed of Grant
* Deed of Variation
* Merger of freehold or leasehold title
* Leasehold supplements
* Change of name
* Telegraphic transfer of surplus funds to borrower
* Local searches for loans over Â£1,000,000
* If an exceptional amount of work is needed to correct a defective title.

The legal firm will discuss any additional costs with your client and obtain their consent before proceeding.

For full details on additional legal work and associated costs, please refer to our Fees and Charges page.

**Additional fees to note**

All remortgage cases may involve administration fees not covered by us:

* **Telegraphic Transfer Fee:** Â£30 + VAT for paying off an existing loan or transferring surplus funds
* **Electronic ID Check Fee:** Â£5 + VAT per customer.

For leasehold properties, a **Leasehold Supplement Fee** of Â£95 + VAT may apply, for example:

* Loan amounts exceeding Â£1 million
* Properties where the landlord is a Local Authority or Housing Association
* Loan to Value (LTV) exceeding 85%.

(These scenarios are examples and not exhaustive.)

## New property details

If your client has an application with us and their purchase falls through, send us a New Property Details Form for a change of property.

By applying for a new property, your client's case will be reassessed by one of our underwriters. This means we may ask you for additional information. Our decision to lend may also be affected if there is a change in their circumstances or the new property isn't considered suitable.

## Number of applicants

Maximum 4. For top slicing and bespoke cases all applicants must reside at the same property. Where proof of income is required for Top Slicing and Bespoke cases, we'll only use the income of the 2 highest earners but assess all applicants' ability to pay.

## Offer expiry

Our offer of loan is valid for a period of 6 months from the date of the offer for both purchases and remortgages, unless stated otherwise in the offer document.

If completion hasn't taken place before the offer expires, we can consider a 6 month extension. The application will be subject to a full reassessment against our current criteria including reverification of income and a revaluation of the property which the applicant will be charged for. A new product may need to be selected from our current range.

For new build offer expiry details please see our 'New build' section.

## Payday loans

We will not normally lend if any applicant has taken out a payday loan in the last year. Applicants with payday loans taken out more than 1 year ago will be assessed individually to make sure affordability can be demonstrated.

## Portability

If your client is looking to move, you could help them port their rate to a new property or take out a new loan with us.

Please see our [Porting and Moving page](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/porting-and-moving/) for more information on how you can help your clients.

## Property condition and letting requirements

Buy to Let properties must predominantly appeal to the residential home owner market, and must already be suitable to be let at the time of the property valuation. They should be tenanted within 60 days of being marketed.

We don't lend on new build flats as a Buy to Let. We can consider ex-council properties but only in good condition and in locations with both a strong rental and owner occupier demand.

For ex-local authority flats we accept a maximum height of 4 storeys. We do not accept blocks with open deck access, unless there is a secure entry-phone system and doors to all stairwells.

For ex- local authority properties we have a minimum value of Â£60,000 (Â£40,000 in Northern Ireland). For ex-local authority flats the minimum value is Â£90,000. For our **Bespoke range**, our minimum loan amount is Â£150,000.

## Rental calculation/margin

**Standard Buy to Let**

Ability to pay is assessed on the rental income (which must be received in Â£GBP).

The rental income must be at least 145% of the monthly interest due inclusive of any product fees added to the loan.

This is calculated using the notional interest rate below (whichever is applicable):

**Notional interest rate:** Fixed &lt;5 years or variable: higher of 5.5% or pay rate + 2%. Fixed 5 years or more: higher of 4.5% or pay rate + 1%.

**Top Slicing and Bespoke**

We'll assess affordability using the applicant's personal income. This can be used to cover a rent shortfall to achieve 145% of the monthly interest due (inclusive of any product fees added to the loan). We'll look at your customer's overall affordability including their credit commitments, residential mortgage and existing Buy to Let properties.

Rental income must be at least 100% of the monthly interest due, inclusive of any product fees added to the loan. This is calculated using the notional interest rate below (whichever applies):

**Notional interest rate:** Fixed &lt;5 years or variable: higher of 5.5% or pay rate + 2%. Fixed 5 years or more: higher of 4.5% or pay rate + 1%.

**Like-for-Like Buy to Let Remortgage**

For landlords who wish to remortgage with no extra borrowing, we'll consider rental income which is at least 125% of the monthly interest for Interest Cover Ratio (ICR) applications.

* No minimum income required
* Ability to pay is assessed on rental income (which must be received in GBP)
* Minimum loan size Â£100,000 (exclusive of any product fees)
* The rental income must be at least 125% of the monthly interest due inclusive of any product fees added to the loan. This is calculated using the relevant stress rate below (whichever applies):

**Stress rate:** Fixed &lt;5 years or variable: 5.5% or pay rate +2%. Fixed 5 years or more: 4.5% or pay rate +1%.

## Roofs

We accept pitched roofs covered with thatch, slates or standard/artificial tiles. Thatched roofs must have specialist insurance cover in place.

**100% Flat Roofs**

Houses with 100% flat roofs may be acceptable if the property is of traditional construction and the valuer confirms saleability and acceptability to other lenders.

For semi-detached and terraced houses, party walls must extend above the flat roof covering between the properties for the property to be acceptable to us.

100% flat roofs on blocks of flats/apartments are generally acceptable.

**Roofs With Single Direction Pitch (Mono-Pitch)**

Roofs which are pitched in a single direction and have materials more commonly used on flat roofed properties, such as felt, asphalt or similar materials, will need to comply with our policy for 100% flat roofs (see below).

For semi-detached and terraced houses, party walls must extend above any flat roof covering between the properties for the property to be acceptable to us.

## Residency status

All applicants **must be resident in the UK** prior to applying.

Applicants **must have lived in the UK long enough to establish a meaningful credit profile and employment history**, typically a minimum of 3 years.

For applicants who do not meet this standard residency period, please refer to the **Foreign Nationals** section for guidance on rights to live and work in the UK.

For good quality clients who don't meet the above requirements, we may still be able to help through our **Bespoke range**. Please [contact us](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/contact-us/) to discuss the case.

## Sale and rent back

Sale and rent backs where the vendor is becoming the tenant upon completion are not acceptable and will be declined.

## Scottish valuations

Transcripts are not permitted.

## Scotland

In Scotland, if it is public knowledge a property is for sale, the seller in most cases must provide a Home Report to prospective buyers. There are some exceptional situations when a seller can choose not to provide a potential purchaser with the Home Report and cases where a Home Report is not actually required. Further information can be found at https://www.mygov.scot/buying-a-home/home-report

For applications where no Home Report is required or available, we'll instruct a mortgage valuation.

The Home Report contains the Property Questionnaire, Single Survey, and an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC); the majority will also contain a Generic Mortgage Valuation Report (GMVR).

For purchase applications we'll request a transcript of the GMVR from the valuer who prepared the original Home Report. That valuer must be on the Bank of Ireland Panel. We'll only accept transcripts from Home Reports that are no more than 12 weeks old. It is the seller's responsibility to obtain a refreshed Home Report if this is older than 12 weeks.

The transcript we receive is valid throughout the offer period and a Home Report refresh is not required. If the offer expires and an offer extension is required, then we'll require a revaluation which the applicant must pay for.

To get the correct product and Loan to Value (where the purchase price is different from the Home Report) you should key the application with the lower of the valuation or purchase price and then in the additional information box put a note on to say what the correct purchase price is. The application must also include the name of the firm that completed the Home Report and the date when the Home Report was undertaken.

If the firm is on our panel and the Home Report in date, then a transcript can be instructed.

If the firm is not on panel, then a Standard valuation would be required, but if the product does not include a fees free valuation or the fees free valuation has already been used, then a valuation fee payment must be taken first.

Missives covers the exchange of correspondence between the purchaser's and seller's solicitors negotiating the conditions of the sale. Property transactions in Scotland become legally binding for all parties upon 'conclusion of Missives'.

**Scottish Private Residential Tenancies (PRT)**

Scottish Private Residential Tenancies (PRT) are acceptable and we'll instruct a mortgage valuation.

**Tenure**

Tenure - typically referred to as Former Feudal, Simple/Absolute ownership is accepted.

Applications can be considered for security on the following Scottish Islands:

Lewis and Harris, Mainland Shetland, Mainland Orkney, Skye, Bute, Arran, Islay, Mull, Whalsay, Yell, South Ronaldsay, West Burra, Tiree and Unst.

Where the valuer identifies a flat with potentially combustible cladding and/or stacked balconies which could facilitate the spread of fire, we'll require the Fire Risk Assessment report (FRA) and Fire Risk Assessment External Walls (FRAEW), together with the names and qualifications of the authors of these documents, for the building. Once we have all of this information, our Property Risk team will assess and advise if acceptable to proceed.

We do not accept EWS1 forms for properties with cladding/stacked balconies.

Please refer to our [fire risk assessments criteria](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/lending-criteria/#fire-risk-assessments) for acceptable qualifications for FRA & FRAEW reports.

All properties 10 storeys or higher must be referred to our Property Risk Team prior to application. Please [contact us](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/contact-us/).

## Solicitors and licensed conveyancers

Please see our [solicitors and licensed conveyancers](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/working-with-us/using-solicitors-and-licensed-conveyancers/) page for details on our panel requirements and acceptable firms.

## Tenancies and vacant possession

**BTL tenancies and vacant possession:** Purchases: England & Wales Yes (vacant or tenant in situ); Scotland & NI Yes with vacant possession, No with tenant in situ. Remortgages: Yes (vacant or tenant in situ) in all regions. Tenanted possession restrictions: England & Wales – tenancy after 28 Feb 1997, tenant not resident before agreement. Scotland – remortgages only if tenant not resident 5 years before offer. Northern Ireland – remortgages only if Protected Shorthold or Uncontrolled Letting. Tenancy types: max 2 years; England AST, Wales Occupation Contract, Scotland Private Residential Tenancy (ex SAT), NI Protected Shorthold or Uncontrolled Letting; max 4 tenants on single AST (or equivalent); company/housing association lets not acceptable.

## Vendor deposits

Vendor paid deposits for second hand properties will be deducted from the gross purchase price to give a true net purchase price. Our maximum LTV lending will be based on this lower sum.

## Valuation appeal

Where an appeal against a valuation is requested we'll need evidence of 3 transactions of similar properties (comparables) to be submitted within 14 working days from the date you were aware of the valuation.

Where appealing both rent and capital values, we'll need 3 comparables for each.

These should be completed sales or lettings within the last 6 months of similar properties and locations, ideally in the same postcode.

**The following information will need to be provided for each comparable item*:**

* Full address (i.e. house or flat number and postcode)
* Details of who sold or let the property
* The agreed sale price or rent
* Date of the transaction
* Source of information.

For any valuation decision queries please get in touch with us via **case message**.

*We don't accept links to web adverts. Estate Agent letters, automated valuations, details of unsold/unlet properties and previous Valuer's opinions aren't considered appropriate evidence and will not be considered.

## Valuation - essential repairs

If a valuation report is received and the survey does not provide a current market value due to a recommendation that specialist reports are required, please be aware of the following:

* The application **may still be declined** even after the reports have been received if there is an issue with the property that does not meet our lending policy
* If there are any recommended works stipulated within the specialist reports, these works **must be completed** before we can proceed with the application

## Valuation fees

To find standard valuation, revaluation and re-inspection fees, please see our [fees and charges page](https://www.bankofireland4intermediaries.co.uk/fees-and-charges/).

## Valuation transcripts

We don't accept valuation transcripts for Buy to Let applications.
