* Part & part (≤ £2.5m total loan): maximum 80% overall; IO element ≤ 75% (remainder must be C&I).

### 2.4 LTV decision flow

1. Determine base cap using repayment type and loan size.
2. Apply scenario cap → use the lower cap.
3. For part & part, ensure total ≤ 80% and IO slice ≤ 75% (if ≤ £2.5m).
4. If flat > 85% LTV, confirm 4 storeys or fewer, not ex-LA/MoD, not new-build.

## SECTION 74 – Valuation Fees

### Valuation report

The only valuation type available is a lender's valuation report which is for Clydesdale to calculate how much we can lend. This may involve a physical inspection of the property or be completed remotely without visiting the property. The customer may want to separately instruct a firm of their choosing to carry out a valuation or survey.

### Fees

We offer a range of products with one free valuation for properties valued up to £3m. If the property is valued over £3m we'll cover the first £1,640 of the valuation fee. Our product details will make clear if a free valuation applies.

The fees below include VAT and an administration fee. The cost to Clydesdale may differ from the fee charged.

We may also charge a reinspection fee of £58.75 where a valuation expires and needs to be updated or where work has been carried out and the valuation needs to be updated.
