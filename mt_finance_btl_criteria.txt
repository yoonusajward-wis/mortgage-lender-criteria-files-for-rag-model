Adverse credit rules apply to the company applicant and all guarantors.

MT Finance imposes no limit on the number of loans an investor can hold with other lenders. Limited companies or LLPs must be registered in England and Wales before offer and may be an SPV or a trading company. For limited companies, guarantors must include all directors and all shareholders with more than a 25% controlling interest; collectively, limited company guarantors must hold at least 60% controlling interest; guarantees are “joint and several”. For LLPs, guarantors include all designated members/general partners and any members with management rights per the LLP agreement, and LLP guarantors must own 100% of the company. All guarantors must be individual directors, shareholders, members, or a connected company, and all must take ILA before entering the transaction.&#x20;

Employment status requires a full 12-month history in employment or self-employment, and at least one applicant must be a UK taxpayer and either employed, self-employed, a contractor, or retired. All applicants must have resided in the UK for the past three years (excluding expats) and must have permanent rights to remain. Portfolio landlords must supply a portfolio schedule, undergo validation of the existing portfolio, keep maximum portfolio leverage to 80% LTV, and demonstrate aggregate portfolio affordability such that gross annual rental income equals or exceeds 125% of aggregate annual mortgage interest-only payments at a stressed rate of 5.00%.&#x20;

Expatriate lending is available only for Tier 1 borrowers up to 70% LTV and only to UK citizens residing in EEA or FATF member countries; requirements include holding a UK bank account, having an active UK credit footprint, and minimum income of £15,000 (or equivalent).&#x20;

## The Loan

MT Finance takes a first legal charge over the security. The term is from 5 to 35 years. Loan sizes range from £25,001 up to £3,000,000 (capped at £2,000,000 on Tier 2). For purchases, lending is against the lower of purchase price or current valuation. For remortgages, £-for-£ remortgages and capital raising for any legal purpose is allowed except for consolidating debts with unsatisfactory conduct (including arrears on secured or unsecured lending, service charges or ground rent), and tax liabilities can only be considered (such as IHT or CGT) where there’s no indication of financial stress. Let-to-buy and remortgages within six months of purchase can be considered on referral.&#x20;

Deposits can come from lawful sources such as savings, investments, pensions, inheritance, sale or remortgage of property, dividends, and family gifts from immediate family (including step in-law relations). A builder’s deposit of up to 5% is acceptable provided there’s no rental guarantee or interest charged over the security. Company funding of deposits can include director loans, partner loans, shareholder equity, or inter-company loans on referral. Repayment can be capital & interest or interest-only.&#x20;

Affordability uses an ICR framework. For 2-year fixes, affordability is assessed at the greater of pay rate + 2% or Bank of England base rate plus 5% (100% base), whereas 5-year fixes are assessed at pay rate. ICR thresholds are: 125% for basic rate taxpayers and for limited company/LLP borrowers on both 2- and 5-year fixes; 140% for higher and additional-rate taxpayers on 2-year fixes (dropping to 125% for 5-year fixes).&#x20;

Maximum LTV and loan vary by property type and tier. For standard properties, up to £1.5m is available at 80% LTV (both tiers); £1.5m–£2m at 75% LTV (both tiers); and £2m–£3m at 75% LTV (Tier 1 only). Small HMOs are up to £2m at 80% LTV (Tier 1) or 75% (Tier 2); large HMOs up to £2m at 75% (Tier 1) or 70% (Tier 2). Small MUFBs are up to £3m at 75% (Tier 1) or 70% (Tier 2); large MUFBs up to £3m at 75% (Tier 1) or 70% (Tier 2). Semi-commercial is up to £2.5m at 75% LTV (Tier 1 only). MT Finance also applies total obligor exposure caps: in Tier 1, up to £1.5m exposure at 80% LTV, £1.5m–£3m at 75%, and £3m–£7.5m at 70%; in Tier 2, up to £1.5m at 80%, £1.5m–£2.5m at 75%, and £2.5m–£5m at 70%.&#x20;
