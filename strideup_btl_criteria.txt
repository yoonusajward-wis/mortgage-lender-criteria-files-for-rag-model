### Documentation and Evidence

**Note:** Documentation and Evidence of income only applies to cases using top-slicing/rental top-up

**Proof of Income: Employed:**
* Latest P60
* 3 most recent payslips
* Latest bank statement showing the salary credit
* If the applicant has just started their new role, and no payslips are available, we will accept a copy of the contract confirming the salary, will need the last 3 payslips from their previous role

**Proof of Income: Self-Employed:**
* Most recent year's income accepted if trading for more than 2 years
* SA302 for the last 2 years, together with the Tax Year Overview (or 1 year if trading for less than 2 years) and 3 months business bank statements
* Where 2 years' SA302/Tax Year Overviews cannot be provided, other sources to evidence stability of income can be considered, subject to underwriter discretion

**Proof of Income: Other Sources:**
* **Child benefit:** Most recent award letter and most recent bank statement showing the credit
* **Working or Child Tax Credits:** Most recent award letter and most recent bank statement showing the credit

**Contractor:**
We are flexible on how we look at contractors, and realise one size does not fit all:
* **First time contracting:** If less than 6 months to run on the contract, we need confirmation the applicant has been previously employed for 24 months in the same line of work
* **Single contract:** 3 month history of contracting is required, with a minimum 12 months history in the same industry (unless first time contracting). There must be a minimum of 3 months remaining on the contract. However, we will accept confirmation of the renewal from the employer if the next contract is not yet available
* **Multiple contracts:** If customer has multiple contracts, we will treat them as Sole Traders, Ltd Co Director and will request the same evidence as detailed above
* **Umbrella Company:** We treat contractors that are paid via an Umbrella Company, which pays tax & NI for our customer, as PAYE employed customers, so we will be looking for the latest P60 & latest 3 payslips
* **Medical professionals:** Whether they work under one or multiple Trusts, we will treat them as a single contractor rather than looking at the SA302s for evidence. Day rates can be considered

**Second Job:**
* We can consider 100% of this income
* If PAYE, our customer must have been working their primary job and second job for 6 months
* We will need the latest P60 & 3 most recent payslips

**Financing into Retirement:**
* **<10 years away from retirement age:** If pension income is to be used for affordability, we will need to see the latest pension statement which will show a forecast of the pension amount
* **>10 years away from retirement age:** Evidence of contributions into a pension fund (including sale of other property and/or buy to let rental income) must be provided and will be reviewed on a proportionate basis

**Expenditure:**
