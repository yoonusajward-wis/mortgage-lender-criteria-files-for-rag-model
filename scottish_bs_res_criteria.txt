## Property Types and Location

### Scottish Building Society Intermediaries Online

The property must be located in Scotland and England as far South as OX postcode.

Please check our Business Development Manager map for acceptable security address postcodes

We do not lend in Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man

### Acceptable Construction Types

1. **Traditional Construction**
   All traditionally built residential properties in good condition are acceptable. This includes homes with walls made of solid stone, cavity brick, or timber frames with brick or stone facing. Pitched roofs that are slated or tiled are also acceptable.
   *Note:* Properties with flat roofs are generally considered unacceptable. However, in exceptional circumstances, a flat-roofed property may be considered if it is of the right type and meets valuer guidance.

2. **Flats**
   Purpose-built flats, converted flats, and studio flats are acceptable, including those located above retail premises. These must generally have no more than five storeys. For properties above this height, approval should be sought by discussing the case with your Business Development Manager (BDM).

3. **Modern Methods of Construction (MMC)**
   The Society is willing to consider properties constructed using modern methods, such as off-site modular or other MMC techniques. These cases will be assessed individually and subject to valuer guidance. Approval depends on whether the property is saleable and insurable, and whether there is a ready market for such construction.

4. **Non-Traditional Construction**
   Certain non-traditional properties may also be acceptable:

* Timber-framed and clad properties can be considered if they are substantial in nature, confirmed as suitable security by a panel valuer, and are in good condition.
* Insitu poured concrete dwellings such as Wimpey No-Fines, Solid No-Fines, and Laing Easiform (built after 1945) are acceptable, again subject to valuer comments and recommendations.

*Important:* These construction types must not be confused with prefabricated reinforced concrete (PRC) dwellings, which are unacceptable.

---

### Unacceptable Construction Types

Some property types are not considered acceptable security. These include:

* Properties with metal roofs, unless the roof forms part of the design of a new-build or self-build property and has been referred to the BDM.
* Prefabricated reinforced concrete (PRC) houses.
* Steel-framed or steel-clad houses. Certain modern steel-framed properties may be acceptable, but only if confirmed suitable by valuation.
* Large Panel System (LPS) dwellings. Examples of these include:

  * Ayrshire County Council (Lindsay)
  * Blackburn-Orlit
  * Boot
  * Dorran
  * Myton-Clyde
  * Orlit
  * Tarran
  * Tarran-Cycle

---

### Acceptable Types of Tenure

The following types of tenure are acceptable:

* Commonhold or outright ownership in Scotland.
* Leasehold properties, though rare in Scotland, may be considered on a case-by-case basis and in line with Society policy.
* Leasehold or freehold properties in the rest of the UK.

*Note:* In all leasehold cases, the unexpired term at the end of the mortgage must be no less than **50 years**.

## Standard Criteria for Mortgages

Scottish Building Society will only consider mortgage applications on a **fully advised** basis. This means that each application must undergo a full assessment of both the applicants’ past credit record and their ability to meet current and future financial commitments, including their mortgage payments and other related expenditure.

The following criteria represent the **minimum requirements** that must be satisfied for applicants to be eligible for an owner-occupier mortgage. Any lending to applicants outside of these standard criteria requires prior approval. It is recommended that any cases that fall outside the Society’s standard criteria should be discussed in full with your Business Development Manager before submission.

---

### Maximum Number of Borrowers

The maximum number of borrowers permitted on an individual mortgage depends on the loan-to-value (LTV). For mortgages up to 95% LTV, the Society will allow a maximum of four borrowers. For mortgages above this threshold, the maximum number of borrowers permitted is three.

---

### Minimum and Maximum Age Criteria

At the start of the mortgage, all parties must be at least **18 years old**, with two exceptions:

* For **Retirement Interest-Only Mortgages**, the minimum age of all parties is **55 years**.
* For the **Professional Mortgage**, the minimum age for the applicant is **21 years**.

The maximum age at the end of the mortgage term is normally **85 years**. If the applicant will be older than their expected retirement age at the end of the term, then affordability using retirement income must be proven. Unless otherwise confirmed, the default assumed retirement age is **70 years**.

There is no maximum age requirement for **Retirement Interest-Only Mortgage** cases.

The minimum mortgage term is **5 years**. The maximum mortgage term is normally set in relation to the borrowers’ expected retirement date, provided that the term does not exceed **40 years**. For Retirement Interest-Only mortgages, there is no maximum term.

---

### Income Multiples

All mortgage applications are assessed based on affordability. As a guide:

* The Society applies a maximum of **4.5x sole and joint income multiples** across all LTV bands.
* For **Professional applicants**, the Society will lend up to **5x sole and joint income multipliers** up to 95% LTV.

Every mortgage application is assessed using the Society’s **Affordability Model**. Additionally, lifestyle issues are assessed by a Mortgage Underwriter, who will inspect the applicant’s bank statements covering the most recent **three-month period**.

---

### Mortgage and Rental Payments

If the conduct of an existing mortgage cannot be verified through bureau data, the following documentation must be obtained:

* Bank or mortgage statements covering the 12 months prior to the application, or
* A lender’s reference.

For first-time buyers who are living in rented accommodation provided by a housing association or local authority, documentary evidence of rental payments must also be obtained. Acceptable evidence includes:

* Bank or rental statements covering the previous 12 months, or
* A landlord’s reference.

For minimum and maximum loan amounts, as well as loan-to-value ratios, please refer to the relevant product page.

---

### Employment Status

Employment status is assessed as follows:

* **Employed Applicants:** Applicants must be in permanent employment and have been employed with their current employer for at least **six months**. If they have been employed for less than six months, they must demonstrate that they were previously employed for a minimum of **12 months** immediately before their current role.

* **Self-Employed Applicants (including company directors):** Applicants must have been conducting their business for at least **two years**. They must be able to provide evidence of income for that period, together with a projection or estimate of income for the coming 12 months. Normally, this would be in the form of an **SA302 with overview** obtained from HMRC.

* **Contractors:** The Society will not lend in excess of **80% LTV** where income is derived from a fixed-term contract, except in the case of **medical professionals** such as NHS doctors. Contractors working on a “Contracts for Services” basis will be treated as self-employed. They must have been engaged in contracts for at least **three years**, with income evidenced by the last three years of tax assessments showing level or progressively rising income. The last six months’ SC60s/715 vouchers must also be provided.

---

### Voters Roll and Proof of Occupancy

Personal status details, including inclusion on the **Voters Roll**, will be checked for all parties to the mortgage (including guarantors) at all addresses within the last three years. If the borrower does not appear on the current Voters Roll, appropriate **proof of occupancy** must be provided.

Proof of identity is also required in line with current **Money Laundering Regulations** and the requirements of the Regulator.

---

### Maximum Incomes for Affordability

The Society applies maximum income levels when calculating affordability. These assessments are always made using the Society’s Affordability Model to ensure that the loan remains affordable, taking into account both current and foreseeable future circumstances.

---

## Self-Employed Requirements

### Acceptable Accountants’ Qualifications

For all mortgages where there is a self-employed applicant, the Accountant’s Certificate may only be signed by an accountant holding one of the following professional qualifications:

* **CA:** The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland.
* **ACA / FCA:** The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales or the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland.
* **ACCA / FCCA:** The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants.
* **ACMA / FCMA:** The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.
* **ATT:** Association of Taxation Technicians.
* **AIA:** Association of International Accountants.
* **IFA:** Institute of Financial Accountants.
* **CPAA:** Certified Public Accountants Association.

Only accountants with one of the above qualifications are permitted to sign the relevant certificates.

---

### Trading History Requirement

Self-employed borrowers, including company directors, must have been conducting their business for a period of **at least two years**. They must also be able to provide evidence of income covering that period, together with a projection or estimate of expected income for the following twelve months.

---

### Required Documentation for Self-Employed Applicants

The following documentation is required for applicants who are self-employed (including company directors):

1. **Accountant’s Certificate**
   A completed Accountant’s Certificate covering at least the most recent three completed years, signed by an approved accountant, will normally be accepted.

2. **Accounts**
   If it is not possible to obtain an Accountant’s Certificate, then at least the last three years’ signed accounts must be obtained.

3. **SA302s (Self-Assessment Returns)**
   If the applicant submits self-assessment returns to HMRC, then copies of the last three SA302 tax calculation forms issued by HMRC should be obtained. However, because SA302s are essentially self-certification and HMRC does not carry out checks on them, further confirmation must also be obtained. This may include:

   * Confirmation of tax paid in previous years via the relevant HMRC Overview sheet.
   * Supporting bank statements.
   * Contracts that evidence the declared income.

4. **Projections and Estimates**
   Where three full years of income cannot be confirmed, projections or estimates must be obtained. The business must have been trading for at least two years, with the results for those years confirmed by the accountant. An estimate or projection should then be provided for the third year.

---

---

## Previous Credit Issues

Applicants with previous credit issues may be considered under certain circumstances. The rules may be segmented into the following sections:

Unacceptable

Acceptable (for consideration)

---

### Unacceptable Credit History

Applications will be declined where any party to the mortgage application meets one or more of the following conditions:

* The applicant is an **undischarged bankrupt**, or has been discharged from bankruptcy within the past three years.
* The applicant is subject to an **Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)**, or has been discharged from an IVA within the past three years.
* The applicant has previously had their property repossessed, including where keys were voluntarily surrendered.
* The applicant has **more than two Court Decrees, County Court Judgments (CCJs), or Defaults**, even if these have since been satisfied or settled.
* The applicant has had **any Court Decrees, CCJs, or Defaults registered within the past 12 months**.
* The applicant has **one or more Court Decrees, CCJs, or Defaults** where the total debt involved was **£2,500 or more**, regardless of when it was registered.
* The applicant has **one or more Court Decrees, CCJs, or Defaults** with a value of **£500 or more registered within the past three years**.

---

### Acceptable for Consideration

Certain circumstances may still allow for an application to proceed:

* Applicants who have been **discharged bankrupts for at least three years**.
* Applicants who have been **discharged from their IVA for at least three years**.
* Applicants who have **not been three months or more in arrears in the past 24 months** on any secured or unsecured loan, and whose account has been up to date for at least the last six months. In these cases, there must also be a **reasonable explanation for the arrears**.

The Society will require a full written explanation of the circumstances surrounding **any Default or CCJ** recorded in the credit file.

Additionally, the Society may consider up to **two satisfied Court Decrees, CCJs, or Defaults**, provided they meet the following conditions:

* A debt of up to **£250** may be considered if it was registered **less than one year ago**.
* A debt of up to **£500** may be considered if it was registered **more than one year ago**.
* A debt greater than **£500 but less than £2,500** may be considered if it was registered **more than three years ago**.

---

---

## Debt Consolidation

The Society will consider lending funds for **debt consolidation** in two scenarios: as part of **additional borrowing when remortgaging to the Society**, or by way of a **Further Advance** for existing Society borrowers.

The **maximum Loan to Value (LTV)** permitted where debt consolidation is involved is **80%**. Debt consolidation lending will only be allowed **once during the lifetime of the mortgage**.

Free Basic Legal Service is **not available** for debt consolidation remortgages. Instead, Scottish Building Society will provide **£250 cashback** towards legal costs.

The Society will **not consider debt consolidation** applications from habitual consolidators who repeatedly use finance to support a lifestyle that their income cannot sustain.

Where debt consolidation involves the repayment of **credit card debt**, it is expected that **all accounts are cleared in full** using the additional borrowing. Partial repayment of credit card balances will not be accepted.

Applicants must provide a **detailed explanation** of why the debts were incurred, along with clear details of which debts are being repaid.

Finally, the Society will assess the outstanding debt relative to the applicant’s income. While there is no defined ratio for this assessment, if there is any concern about the relationship between debt levels and income, the case must be **referred to the mortgage underwriters**.

---

---

## Interest Only Mortgages

The Society will only permit lending on an **interest-only basis** if there is a credible and verifiable plan for repayment of the capital sum at the end of the mortgage term.

---

### Basic Criteria

Any request for lending on an interest-only basis, whether at the start of the mortgage or during its term, must meet the following criteria:

* **Maximum Loan to Value (LTV):** 75%
* **Maximum Loan Size:** £500,000

---

### Acceptable Repayment Vehicles

The following repayment vehicles are considered acceptable for interest-only lending:

1. **Endowment Policies**
   Endowment policies are acceptable if the projected growth rate at 4% will generate sufficient funds to repay the mortgage borrowing in full. If there is a projected shortfall, the shortfall must currently be placed on a capital repayment basis. A copy of the latest projection statement, dated within the last 12 months, must be provided.

2. **Stocks and Shares ISAs**
   Stocks and shares ISAs are acceptable provided that the Society receives a letter from the ISA provider confirming that the projected value at maturity is sufficient to allow full repayment of the mortgage.

3. **Pension Lump Sums**
   Pension lump sums are acceptable, provided that the projected lump sum, based on 4% growth, is sufficient to repay the mortgage in full. This may include lump sums from a final salary scheme, and multiple pensions can be combined. A copy of the latest projection statement, dated within the last 12 months, must be provided.

4. **Second or Investment Properties**
   Equity in a second or investment property can be used as a repayment vehicle, subject to the following rules:

   * For mortgages maturing in more than five years, the **current equity** in the second property must be sufficient to repay the mortgage in full.
   * For mortgages maturing within five years, the current equity in the second property must be at least **120% of the mortgage balance**.

   In all such cases, full details of the property must be provided, including confirmation of ownership and evidence of any outstanding mortgage debt. A recent valuation report or AVM report must also be obtained to verify the property value.

---

### Affordability Assessment

Any monthly contributions made towards these repayment vehicles must be included in the affordability calculation.

Where applicants wish to discuss alternative repayment methods not listed above, they should speak to their **Business Development Manager (BDM)** for further guidance.

---

### Sale of Mortgaged Property

The **sale of the mortgaged property** as a repayment vehicle will be considered, subject to the following criteria:

* The maximum LTV shall be **50%** where the borrower intends to rely entirely on the sale of the property.
* An LTV of up to **75%** will be available where 25% of the borrowing is placed on a repayment basis, thereby reducing the balance to 50% LTV by the end of the term.
* The minimum term shall be **10 years**.
* The term must not extend beyond the borrower reaching **age 70**.
* The minimum equity in the property must be **£200,000**. For example, where a borrower exercises the full 50% LTV, the minimum property value must be £400,000. However, a borrower seeking £100,000 on a £300,000 property would still be able to access interest-only, as the equity requirement would be met.
* The maximum loan shall be **£500,000** where the sale of the mortgaged property is used as the repayment vehicle.

---

---

## Lending in/into Retirement

The Society undertakes lending to two categories of borrower where the end of the mortgage term will fall after retirement. These categories are:

1. The Society’s **Retirement Interest-Only (RIO) Mortgage**.
2. Standard lending defined as **lending in or into retirement**.

For both categories, special provisions and additional requirements may apply.

---

### Legal Services and Certificates

Free Basic Legal Service is **not available** for Retirement Interest-Only remortgages, nor for remortgages where any party to the mortgage is **aged 70 or above at the time of application**.

Instead, the Society will provide **£250 cashback** towards legal costs. In such cases, Scottish Building Society requires the customers’ solicitors to complete a **Later Life Certificate** if any party to the mortgage is aged 70 or above at application, or a **Retirement Interest-Only Certificate** if the application is specifically for a Retirement Interest-Only mortgage.

It is important to note that the Society does **not cover the cost** of any additional legal work associated with these certificates.

---

### Maximum Age

The Society applies different age criteria depending on the product:

* For **Owner-Occupier Mortgages**, the normal maximum age is **85 years**.
* For **Retirement Interest-Only Mortgages**, there is **no maximum age**.

---

### Retirement Income and Affordability

For Retirement Interest-Only Mortgages, the Society requires **comfort and assurance** that the borrower’s retirement income will be sufficient to cover ongoing monthly mortgage payments.

For general lending in or into retirement, the Society considers **70 years of age** to be the normal retirement age. These mortgages operate in the same way as standard residential mortgages, as they are taken for a specified term by the end of which the borrowing must be repaid.

The Society will consider mortgage applications where the term extends beyond the borrower’s expected retirement age, normally up to a maximum age of 85, provided the borrower can demonstrate a **sustainable income stream** that ensures the mortgage will remain affordable throughout its term. This includes affordability following any foreseeable change in circumstances, such as retirement.

The Society adopts a **prudent and proportionate approach** to assessing income beyond retirement age. The closer the borrower is to retirement, the more robust the evidence of retirement income will need to be.

---

### Guarantor Cases

For guarantor mortgages, if the personal guarantor is expected to make contributions towards mortgage payments and will themselves be in retirement, an **appropriate affordability assessment** will also be carried out. This will be in line with the same approach used for standard retirement lending, ensuring the mortgage remains affordable throughout the term.

---

### Legal Advice and Costs

Legal advice associated with later life lending may attract **additional costs** beyond solicitors’ standard charges. Borrowers should therefore be prepared for higher legal expenses when arranging mortgages that extend into retirement or when applying for a Retirement Interest-Only Mortgage.

---

---

## Sustainable Income

### Mortgages with and without Mortgage Indemnity Guarantee (MIG)

Where the requested borrowing is **more than 80% loan-to-value (LTV)**, the Society will usually require Mortgage Indemnity Guarantee (MIG) insurance, except in the case of the Professional Mortgage.

If the borrowing is **equal to or less than 80% LTV**, there is no requirement for MIG and the Society may adopt a more flexible approach.

---

### Differing Requirements for Cases with and without MIG

### Differing Requirements for Cases with and without MIG

### Employed Applicants

For employed applicants, the Society may use a combination of earned income (including allowances) and investment income to determine what the applicant’s sustainable income will be in the foreseeable future.

When MIG applies (over 80% LTV), the following rules govern the inclusion of additional employment-related income:

* Overtime may be included up to a maximum of **25% of gross basic annual salary**.
* Commission may be included up to a maximum of **25% of gross basic annual salary**.
* Bonuses may be included up to a maximum of **25% of gross basic annual salary**.
* The sum of all additional employment-related income (overtime, bonuses, commission, rent allowances, shift allowances) should not exceed **50% of the gross basic annual salary**.

When MIG does not apply (under 80% LTV), the Society will primarily assess income on the same basis. However, the underwriter may adopt a degree of **flexibility** in calculations, provided that sustainability can be evidenced and an appropriate rationale is given.

---

### Self-Employed Applicants

For sole traders or partners, the Society normally requires the **average share of the last three years’ net trading profit**.

If only a two-year track record exists, an estimate or projection for the coming year may be used alongside the previous two years, but only if:

1. Annual turnover is level or progressively rising.
2. Net profit (and the applicant’s share of it) is level or progressively rising.
3. The applicant’s drawings do not exceed their share of net profit in any accounting period.

When MIG does not apply (under 80% LTV), self-employed and company director applicants will be assessed by the Mortgage Underwriter. The underwriter will consider at least **one year of financial history** (final accounts or an accountant’s certificate) along with a projection for the coming year. The type of business in which the applicant operates will strongly influence the assessment of income sustainability.

---

### Company Directors

For directors of a limited company, the Society normally requires the **average salary and dividend over the last three years**.

Where only a two-year track record exists, an estimate or projection for the coming year may be used in conjunction with the previous two years, provided that:

1. Annual turnover is level or progressively rising.
2. Net profit is level or progressively rising.
3. Salary plus gross dividends are level or progressively rising.

---

### Important Note

For all cases, **any monthly contributions** towards repayment vehicles or income-related commitments must be included in the affordability assessment.

---

## Confirmation of Income

### Employed Borrowers

The Society's standard documentation requirements for confirmation of income are that the applicant submits:

* Their most recent P60 and
* 3 recent months' payslips (one of which must be for the month prior to application)

For mortgages where the borrowing is **>80% LTV**, an employer's reference will be obtained (in writing).

A previous employer's reference should be obtained if the borrower has been in their current employment for less than 6 months.

---

### Lending into Retirement

Where the borrowing is to be supported by pension income, the following evidence should be obtained:

* Where the pension is already being received: the most recent annual pension statement or latest 3 monthly pension advices. Bank statements are also acceptable.
* If future pension income: a pension illustration from within the last 12 months with projected pension income should be obtained.
* Unless advised of an earlier date, the default age for retirement is **age 70**.
* Pension income is often derived from more than a single source and the Society will accept **100% from each source**.

---

### Required Documentation for Self-Employed Applicants (including company directors)

* A completed Accountant's Certificate covering at least the most recent 3 completed years, and obtained from an approved accountant, will be accepted for borrowers who are self-employed.
* If it's not possible to obtain an Accountant's Certificate, at least the last 3 years' signed accounts should be obtained.
* If the applicant submits a self-assessment return to HMRC, copies of the last 3 tax calculation forms (SA302) issued by HMRC should be obtained. However, as SA302s are in effect self-certification and no checks are carried out by HMRC, additional comfort must be obtained. This may take the form of confirmation of tax paid in previous years via the relevant HMRC Overview sheet, bank statements or contracts.
* Projections/estimates should be obtained if 3 years income cannot be confirmed. The business must have been trading for at least two years with the results confirmed by the accountant with an estimate/projection provided for the third year.

---

## Foreign National Applicants

Foreign national applicants who meet all other lending criteria will only be considered, subject to the following conditions. Lending is available up to **95% LTV**, and terms are aligned with the other LTV bands applied to UK Nationals. Applicants must have a **minimum residency in the UK of 3 years** and must also possess **Indefinite Leave to Remain**.

The Society will also accept applications from **Medical Doctors** who hold a **Healthcare Visa**.

### Residency

The Society will only consider mortgage applications where the borrower’s **main residence is deemed to be in the UK**.

However, the Society will accept applications for consideration where the borrower is employed overseas, provided that two conditions are met:

1. There is a proven **track record of income being paid into a UK bank account**.
2. The property in the UK will be **occupied by the borrower’s immediate family**, which is defined as a spouse and children.

---

---

## Non-UK Employment / Remuneration

### Non-UK Employment

The Society will only consider mortgage applications where the borrower’s **main residence is in the UK**.

However, the Society will accept applications for consideration where the borrower is **employed overseas**, provided that the following conditions are met:

* The property taken as security must be the borrower’s **main residence**.
* The maximum Loan to Value (LTV) is **80%**.
* The borrower must have a **minimum sterling-equivalent income of £40,000**.
* There must be a proven **track record of income paid into a UK bank account**, and this must be evidenced.
* If the borrower is paid in a foreign currency, the income must be **credited to a UK bank account in sterling**.
* In its affordability assessment, the Society will apply a **stress test to income received in foreign currency**.
* The property must be occupied by the borrower’s **immediate family**, defined as the spouse and children, and the spouse must be a party to the mortgage.

### Non-Sterling Remuneration

The Society will normally only consider foreign currency applications where borrowers are paid in **US Dollars, Euros, or Norwegian Krone**.

All foreign currency applications must be **referred to your Business Development Manager (BDM)** in the first instance.

---

---

## Valuation of New Builds

The Society recognises that the initial value of **newly built, converted, or renovated residential properties** often reflects a **premium** because they are being occupied for the first time. For the purpose of this policy, such properties are collectively referred to as **“new builds.”**

When assessing the value of new builds, the Society relies on the assurance that the **Disclosure of Incentives form**—provided by the builder or property developer to the valuer—has been fully considered in the valuation provided.

In terms of maximum borrowing limits, the following apply:

* For **new build houses**, the maximum borrowing permitted is **95% LTV**.
* For **new build flats**, the maximum borrowing permitted is **90% LTV**. However, for **Professional applicants**, the limit extends to **95% LTV**.

**Note:** Maximum Loan to Value (LTV) ratios are **subject to change** and should always be verified against the latest policy updates.
