---

## First Time Buyers are Defined as

---

## Proof of Deposit

- 6 month history required, except where the deposit is being funded by equity in the existing residential property (which is validated by Tandem's solicitors)

---

## Acceptable Sources of Deposits are

- Equity from sale of property
- Savings, Investments, Shares, or Inheritance
- Family Gifted Deposit
- Family Gifted Equity
- Assisted deposits such as builder deposit and builder incentive
- Personal Loan (cannot be provided by any Tandem Group product)

---

## Gifted Deposits from Family Members are Subject to

- A completed gifted deposit form

---

## Purchases Undervalue and Gifted Equity Transactions are Only Permitted Where the Donor is a Family Member and are Subject to

- Receipt of a gifted equity form
- Declaration of solvency from the vendor - this is required to ensure that the vendor is not bankrupt or approaching bankruptcy
- Vendors must have owned property they are selling for minimum 6 months

---

## Where the Source of Deposit is by a Personal Loan

- Copy of the credit agreement confirming the amount borrowed and monthly repayments
- The monthly payments factored into the affordability assessment

---

## Applicant is Married or Co-habiting

- The loan must be in joint names unless there is a plausible reason to proceed in sole name, e.g., the existing property is currently owned in sole name

---

## Where the Property is/or to be Registered in a Sole Name of One Applicant, is Acceptable Subject to

- Both borrowers residing in the property
- ILA for the applicant who is not a registered owner (cannot be obtained via remortgage free legals)

---

## Unsecured Loans/HP

- Any unsecured loans/HP with 3 months (6 for purchase) left to run can be ignored from the affordability assessment
- Extra care should be taken where HPs are concerned as some car leases will be expected to be renewed/continued
- The time remaining must be calculated by taking the outstanding balance divided by the monthly instalment

---

## Debt Consolidation and Purchases

- Debt consolidation is only available on remortgage applications
- However, on purchase applications, Tandem may consider accepting a solicitor's undertaking to evidence that an account will be settled on completion which can therefore be ignored from the affordability calculation
- Tandem may request evidence that the account was settled post completion of the loan
- For accounts where a monthly payment is used for affordability purposes, Tandem allows the account to be part settled but only ignores the remaining balance if it equates to less than 3 months (6 for purchase) payments

---

## Legal Representation

- Where Tandem is lending to purchase the property it is a standard legal process
- Where Tandem is lending to remortgage the property, we will provide standard lender only legals and cover the costs of consolidating any credit. If the applicant requires representing in any way, they must be represented by his or her own solicitor, legal executive, or licensed conveyancer
