Similarly, properties that can only be used for retirement or sheltered accommodation are not acceptable. This is the same for any property where a planning restriction (e.g. agricultural restriction) effectively limits a property’s appeal on the open market.

Subject to surveyors comments, we may require a specialist’s report for the property, these most commonly comprise of: Timber and damp (T&D); Electrical; Trees; Cavity Wall Tie; Mining Report

SOLAR PANELS
============

We will consider a property that contains solar panels. The conveyancing solicitor would need to review the lease, if there is anything within the lease that can have an effect on the security property then we may not be able to consider your application. This could be an overriding interest in the property, or they have a right to take these solar panels down at any time, as this may cause damage to the property if they choose to do this.

STRUCTURAL REPORTS
==================

Where ongoing movement is reported, or a period of monitoring is recommended by a surveyor, we are unable to lend.
