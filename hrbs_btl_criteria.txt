## Portfolio Landlord

**Source:** https://intermediaries.hrbs.co.uk/criteria/portfolio-landlord/

### Definition of a Portfolio Landlord

An applicant who has **four or more qualifying Buy to Let mortgaged properties**, including:

* Properties owned in the name of a limited company where the applicant holds more than 25% of the shares
* Properties held on a consent to let basis
* Holiday lets

**For joint applications:** If the combined number of qualifying properties exceeds three, then the application will be classed as portfolio lending.

### Portfolio Landlord Specific Criteria

The easiest way to check if your client's portfolio is likely to be acceptable for lending purposes is to get in touch with our team. This calculator considers the Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) of the subject property individually and of the portfolio as a whole, the number of properties in the portfolio, the LTV of the portfolio, the level of experience of the applicant(s) and the rate at which the portfolio has grown.

**Our criteria for this is:**

* **ICR Requirement:** The ICR of the subject property, and the portfolio as a whole, must be at least **145%** when calculating the monthly payment at a reference rate of **5.5%**
* **Maximum Number of Properties:** The maximum number of qualifying properties to be held in a portfolio is **20**
* **Acquisition Rate:** Applicants must not have acquired more than **three BTL properties in the last 12 months**
* **Landlord Experience:** At least one applicant must have a minimum of **24 months' experience as a landlord**
* **Maximum LTV:** The maximum LTV of the portfolio of qualifying properties, including the subject property and any unencumbered properties, is **70%**
* **Maximum Age:** The applicant's age must not exceed **80 at the end of the mortgage term**

### Important Notes

* In addition to the general and portfolio landlord-specific criteria, each case will be assessed individually by our portfolio underwriting team
* Checks will include consideration as to whether there is any over reliance on background properties with energy performance ratings below the minimum regulatory requirements, to deliver overall affordability
* **Top-slicing is NOT available for portfolio landlords** - Whilst we accept a combination of rental income and personal income for non-portfolio landlords (commonly known as top-slicing), this is not true for portfolio landlords

### Submitting an Application

The application process and required documentation for portfolio landlords are the same as for non-portfolio applications. Details of the background properties are requested on the application form – please ensure that you capture in readiness, for both mortgaged and unencumbered properties:

* Names of the account holders
* Property address
* Rental income
* Monthly mortgage payment (if any)
* Current lender and account number
* Balance outstanding (if any)
* Mortgage repayment basis
* Current property value
* EPC rating

## Top-Slicing

**Source:** https://intermediaries.hrbs.co.uk/criteria/topslicing/

### Overview

Every case is reviewed manually, and if there is a shortfall in rental income for the affordability assessment we are here to help.

If the mortgage is not self-supporting at the stressed rate and top-slicing is to be considered, the shortfall in rental income must be assessed as coverable by the borrower's personal income.

### Key Criteria

**Please note:**

* **Product Availability:** Top-slicing is available on all our BTL products **except Visa BTL**
* **Minimum ICR:** The rental income must meet the minimum ICR allowable for top slicing of **100%**
* **Portfolio Landlords:** Top-slicing is **not available to portfolio landlords** (having four or more rental properties currently mortgaged)
* **JBSP Mortgages:** Top-slicing can also be considered on Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor (JBSP) mortgages

### How It Works

Top-slicing allows the Society to consider a combination of rental income and personal income to meet affordability requirements. This is particularly useful where:

* The rental income alone does not meet the required ICR at the stressed rate
* The applicant has sufficient personal income to cover the shortfall
* The property is not self-supporting but the applicant can demonstrate ability to cover the shortfall

### Contact for Eligibility
