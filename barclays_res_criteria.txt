### Additional borrowing

You need to treat requests for additional borrowing by existing mortgage customers as new lending, with the reason fully explained. Current policy rules apply to the combined total of the mortgage and additional lending. There are two exceptions to this (age and term) where policy requirements only apply to the additional amount borrowed.

A maximum LTV of 85%* may be considered (subject to product availability). A maximum LTV of 80% applies where the purpose of additional borrowing (ie further advance) is for debt consolidation.

* Maximum LTV for additional borrowing on interest only will depend on the repayment vehicle selected, see interest-only policy section.

For all new lending requests a valuation must be carried out irrespective of when the original valuation was undertaken.

- Additional borrowing applications can exceed the term of the main mortgage account but must not exceed 40 years from the date the mortgage originally began, or 25 years for a mortgage with any element that is interest only. For Family Springboard mortgages, additional borrowing can't be taken while the deposit is locked, or exceed 35 years
- Interest only – the total new aggregate amount of interest-only borrowing, including any existing borrowing, must meet current interest-only standards, including for the repayment plan, plausibility assessment and minimum income requirements
- Repayment plan and LTV – changes in the repayment plan that the lending was already assessed against must meet the current interest-only standards. This applies whether the additional lending is on an interest-only or repayment basis
- For any applications involving the consolidation of an existing Mortgage Current Account Reserve debt, a condition of offer must be accepted by the customer that their Mortgage Current Account Reserve limit shall be reduced to zero/capped and any rebalancing feature should be switched off
- Additional borrowing is not allowed to support any demolish and re-build scenarios which are seen as a clear breach in Mortgage Terms & Conditions entered into by the borrower
- Since 16 October 2019, customers can only hold up to nine accounts in addition to their main mortgage. 

**Additional borrowing on offset mortgages**

Clients who already have an offset mortgage with us and want to borrow more can't keep their current offset product. They'll need to choose from one of these options, based on their circumstances.

1. **Keep the offset feature and borrow more against the same property**. You'll need to submit an application for a new offset mortgage from our offset product range. The application needs to be for the total of the old mortgage balance plus the further borrowing (the total mortgage amount).
2. **Keep the offset feature and borrow more when buying a new property.** You'll need to submit an application for the new total mortgage amount, selecting a product from our current offset range.
3. **Remove the offset feature and borrow more against the same property**. Contact us for a bespoke rate switch product code, and you can submit an application to switch their mortgage to an equivalent, non-offset product on the same rate. Once complete, you can submit a new application for the additional borrowing.
4. **Remove the offset feature and port the mortgage to a new property.** If your client wants to keep their current rate when moving and borrow more, but no longer needs the offset feature, contact us for a bespoke product code. We'll port their current rate to an equivalent, non-offset product on the same rate.

### Adverse credit history – Residential

**County Court Judgements (CCJs/defaults)**

Adverse credit as detailed below must be declined:

- Any unsatisfied CCJ
- More than 1 satisfied CCJ and the latest is registered within the past 3 years
- Satisfied CCJs totalling more than £200 and the latest is registered within the past 3 years
- More than 3 satisfied defaults* and the latest is registered within the past 3 years
- Satisfied defaults* totalling more than £200 and the latest is registered within the past 3 years
- Any outstanding default, irrespective of amount
- If it is identified that a limited company, in which an applicant has greater than 15% shareholding, has any outstanding judgements totalling more than £5,000

*Includes partially settled defaults which will be referred out to check whether full and final settlement has been made

Applications can be considered where the above is identified but only where documentary evidence of a settled dispute has been provided by the customer.

**Payment Arrears/Missed Payments**

Application must be declined if any of the following apply:

- The applicant has had three or more months of missed payments (secured or unsecured) in the last two years, even if those months weren't in a row.
- The applicant has had two or more months arrears on any one account in the last six months.
**Payment Arrangements**
If payment arrangements are identified in the credit search which are still running or have ended less than 1 year prior to the time of application, the case must be declined.
**Over-indebtedness**
Where the total unsecured bureau debt (credit cards, overdrafts and loans) is greater than or equal to the gross annual income used in the affordability assessment then the application will be declined. This includes where customers were looking to consolidate the borrowing on to the mortgage.
These standards only apply on drawn balances (unused credit limits are not included). This calculation is automatically applied by the system.
**Mortgage or rent arrears**  

If arrears of more than 1 month have occurred in the past 6 months, and/or 3 months arrears have occurred in the past 2 years, the case is outside lending policy and is to be declined. However, this decision could be changed if there is an acceptable 'technical' reason, or if evidence of a settled dispute is provided and verified by the lender.
If this is the case, please contact our Intermediary Mortgage Experts on 0345 073 3330 * to discuss whether we will be able to assist. Lines are open Monday to Friday 9am-5pm.

**Bankruptcy/IVA**
It is not acceptable to lend where any applicant is currently bankrupt or subject to a Debt Relief Order (DRO) and/or Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) however, lending can be considered provided any bankruptcy, DRO or IVA was registered more than 6 years ago from the date of submission (and hence no longer appears on the credit reference bureau information).
**If your client has a more complex credit history?**
You may wish to visit Kensington Mortgages, one of the UK’s leading specialist lenders and a subsidiary of Barclays Bank UK PLC.

### Affordability – Residential
It is important that we demonstrate that an applicant can reasonably afford to repay their mortgage before we agree to enter into a regulated mortgage contract with them. The use of income multiples alone is not sufficient to assess the maximum amount we'll lend.
Your client’s affordability will also be assessed using information collected in the 'Affording your Mortgage' section of our application. Here, you'll need to detail their regular financial commitments to show that they can afford to make the required monthly repayments.
There are several factors to take into account when assessing your client’s ability to repay their mortgage

**Income assessment**  
This should include the applicant’s actual verified income, net of tax and National Insurance. When making a lending decision or contract variation the underwriters can consider various sources of income (please see the requirements table). The underwriter must consider the variability of the income over time to ensure the mortgage payments remain affordable to the customer. Variable (or non-guaranteed income) must be verified over a sufficient period to inform an assessment of sustainability.

**Expenditure assessment**  
The data captured in the application must take into account committed expenditure (eg credit cards, overdraft, council tax, loans, hire purchase, school fees). Basic essential expenditure and basic quality of living costs will be accounted for in the affordability model.

**Monthly mortgage commitment**  
The monthly repayment must be met from the applicant’s actual or reasonably anticipated income. If the applicant intends to repay from resources other than income, reference to information given by the applicant must be given on the application form.

**For repayment mortgages**  
The monthly repayment used in affordability must be calculated on a capital and interest repayment basis. This should be based on the applicant's current affordability rate or pay rate, whichever is higher. This should also be based on the term of the mortgage or until the applicant is 70, or at the normal retirement of the principal applicant (main income earner), whichever is sooner. For any repayment mortgage term greater than 35 years and up to 40 years, a maximum term of 35 years would be applied for affordability purposes.  

**For interest only mortgages**  
The monthly repayment used in affordability must be calculated on a capital and interest repayment basis at the current affordability rate or pay rate, whichever is higher. This should be over an assumed term of 25 years or until the applicant is 70 or at the normal retirement of all applicants, whichever is sooner. Please note, for interest only mortgages the maximum term is 25 years. Where income into retirement from any applicant is required to meet affordability, it is not acceptable to lend on an interest-only basis.

**Second or subsequent properties**  
Second or subsequent properties: commitments in the form of mortgage payments on second properties, other than those on properties confirmed as Buy to Let or Permission to Let properties, will be automatically applied on a standard repayment basis over the outstanding mortgage term at the current affordability rate or current payment amount, whichever is the higher when assessing affordability.
Where a credit limit applies to the existing mortgage borrowing, then it is this figure, including any undrawn monies, that should be used when assessing affordability.
In addition, a fixed-value commitment for each additional mortgaged residential property held is applied by the system to cover all other costs – this only applies to other residential properties, i.e. second residential homes, but not any property confirmed as being on a Buy to Let or Permission to Let basis.
The running costs (e.g. home insurance, utilities and council tax) of any residential unencumbered properties need to be included in the affordability assessment – please manually enter figures on the Commitments screen.

**Buy-to-let/ Permission-to-let properties: Commitments in the form of contractual monthly mortgage payments on background buy to let/ permission to let properties will be applied automatically.**

**Remaining disposable income**  
The applicant’s 'disposable income' – ie, their monthly income after accounting for regular commitments as detailed above, must be sufficient to cover all other general living expenses, eg food, clothing, utility bills, hobbies.
**Disposable income requirements are set by Barclays and must be met in all instances. Where these levels of disposable income are not realised, the application will be declined.**

### Age/Term

Minimum age: 18

Maximum age at the end of the mortgage term cannot exceed the oldest applicants 80th birthday.

Our maximum acceptable retirement age is 75, please note when the retirement age exceeds 70 our underwriting team may review the application and require additional information.

Where the mortgage term will go beyond age 75 proof of pension income must be provided, where the applicants income is required for affordability.

You'll need to submit documents to prove affordability for the full mortgage term.

Our underwriters will need to see documents that show your client will be able to keep up with their mortgage payments when they've retired:

- Where the applicant is within 10 years of retirement, the case must meet affordability on pension income alone
- Where the applicant is further than 10 years from retirement, the document will only need to show evidence of pension provision. Affordability will not have to be met on pension income alone

You'll also need to confirm that you've discussed affordability in retirement with your client, and that they're comfortable they'll be able to meet the mortgage repayments until the end of the mortgage term.

We can consider applications on an interest-only basis up to age 75. However, affordability must be demonstrated up to age 70. For repayment mortgages, terms may extend beyond 75 either where a younger applicant meets the affordability requirements or where customers can show evidence that they'll be able to pay the mortgage in retirement.

### Armed Forces Personnel

UK Armed Forces personnel currently working in the UK or overseas who wish to buy or re-mortgage a property to let, and who intend to occupy the property as their main residence in the future or on their eventual return to the UK, are acceptable applicants.

It is acceptable to let the mortgaged property on an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) basis.

Service personnel may also be offered a Forces Help to Buy (FHTB) loan, which replaces the previous Long Service Advance of Pay (LSAP). This is typically a 10-year interest-free loan of up to £25,000.

This loan may be used as a deposit toward the property purchase but should be treated as a loan commitment in the affordability assessment, with the monthly repayments deducted from the applicant’s income.

Please refer to the Help to Buy – Forces Help to Buy policy section for further details.

### Bonus, Overtime or Commission

**Documentation**

- Monthly Bonus - 3 latest payslips which evidence monthly bonus amounts they have received ( Bonus must appear on 3 out of 3 monthly payslips and at least 1out of 5 weekly payslips or 3 out of 13 weekly payslips)
- Monthly Overtime or Commission -3 latest payslips which evidence at least 1 amount

P60 will be needed where more than 50% of the most recent 3-month average BOC income is used for affordability. Where more than 100% is used, two years of P60s are required to evidence sustainability.
**Monthly Bonus**

Identify if monthly* bonus is on the most recent 3 month's* payslips

We'll never use less than 50% of the most recent 3 months' average

Average the total monthly bonus amounts from the last 3 month's* payslips and use the same payslips to compare the annualised figure against the P60

You'll need to deduct the salary, allowances and any bonus payments that are less frequent than monthly (or more) when reviewing a P60 and calculating the monthly bonus

The remaining figure should then be divided by 12 to show the monthly average from the P60

Take the lower of the following 2 figures (unless the minimum 50% applies)

- 100% of the 3 months' average
- 100% of the latest P60 monthly average

If more than 100% of BOC income is used for affordability, use the lower of the monthly averages derived from two years of P60s.*

*If frequency of pay is not monthly (e.g. bi weekly / 4 weekly / weekly), Please see weekly, 2-weekly or 4-weekly section below.
**Annual Bonus**

You'll need to use the gross (pre-tax) bonus figure when calculating your customer's bonuses.

- Bonuses paid less frequently than monthly are classed as annual
- Bonuses paid monthly or more frequently are classed as monthly*

* See Monthly Bonus section for further details

**Note** - Your customer is not required to have been with the same employer for 2 years, however, the most recent annual bonus must have been paid by their current employer and, in all cases, must have been paid within the last 12 months. An annual bonus can be considered where it has only been paid in the most recent year.

**Payslips**

The number of payslips required is dependent on the frequency of the bonus. We need evidence of their annual bonus over the last 2 years.

- If your customer receives their bonus Quarterly then we need 8 payslips which evidence the bonus payment
- If your customer receives their bonus Half Yearly then we need 4 payslips which evidence the bonus payment
- If your customer receives their bonus Annually then we need 2 payslips which evidence the bonus payment

**Note** - You can use the payslips to show annual bonuses over the last 2 years (We don't need P60s to validate, and we require no additional calculations).

**P60s**

Where your customer can't provide the required payslips, we need to confirm the annual bonus is sustainable using the last 2 years P60s.

P60's are only acceptable where the customer is not also in receipt of regular bonus, overtime or commission.

Obtain the P60s to confirm bonus over the last 2 years.

Calculate the annual bonus figure for both years

If the latest years bonus figure is lower than the previous years, you can only use the latest years figure. If it is higher than the previous years you can use an average of the two years
**Calculate Overtime or commission**

Identify if monthly* overtime/commission is showing on at least 1 of the most recent 3 month's* payslips

Average the total monthly* overtime/commission amounts from the last 3 month's* payslips and use the same payslips to compare the annualised figure against the P60

You'll need to deduct the salary, allowances and any bonus payments that are less frequent than monthly (or more) when reviewing a P60 and calculating the monthly overtime/commission

The remaining figure should then be divided by 12 to show the monthly average from the P60

Take the lower of the following 2 figures (unless the minimum 50% applies)

- 100% of the 3 months' average
- 100% of the latest P60 monthly average

If the frequency of pay is not monthly (e.g., bi-weekly, 4-weekly, or weekly), refer to the ‘Weekly, 2-Weekly or 4-Weekly’ section for conversion guidance.

**Examples**
Example 1 – Bonus (evidenced on 3 consecutive most recent payslips)

Example 1 – Bonus (evidenced on 3 consecutive most recent payslips)

Basic Salary: £20,000

Monthly Bonus (average over last 3 months): £1,000

P60 Total Income: £23,000

Bonus Amount (P60 value): £3,000 ÷ 12 = £250 per month

Monthly Bonus Figure to Use: £500 per month

Decision:
As the P60 monthly average value (after basic salary is deducted) is less than 50% of the latest 3 payslips’ average, the figure added to the application is £500 per month (50% of the current average monthly bonus = £1,000 × 50%).

Example 2 – Overtime (evidenced on at least 1 out of 3 recent payslips)

Basic Annual Income: £20,000

Monthly Overtime (average over last 3 months): £1,000 per month

P60 Total Annual Income: £29,000

Less Basic Annual Income: £20,000

Overtime Amount (P60 average value): £9,000 ÷ 12 = £750 per month

Overtime Figure to Use: £750 per month

Decision:
As the P60 monthly average value (after basic salary is deducted) is lower than 100% of the average of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to MAX is £750 per month (use the lower of the two averages).

Example 3 – Commission (evidenced on at least 1 out of 3 recent payslips)

Basic Annual Income: £20,000

Commission (average over last 3 months): £1,000 per month

P60 Total Annual Income: £38,000

Less Basic Annual Income: £20,000

Commission Amount (P60 average value): £18,000 ÷ 12 = £1,500 per month

Commission Figure to Use: £1,000 per month

Decision:
As the P60 monthly average value (after basic salary is deducted) is higher than 100% of the average of the latest 3 payslips, the figure added to MAX is £1,000 per month (use the lower of the two averages).

### Income Conversion Methods

If the income is monthly, use the latest month’s payslip figure.
If the income is 4-weekly, use the latest payslip figure, multiply it by 13 to get the annual figure, and then divide that by 12 to get the equivalent monthly figure.
If the income is 2-weekly, total the figures from the last three payslips, divide by 6 to get the average weekly pay, multiply that by 52 to obtain the annual figure, and then divide by 12 to get the equivalent monthly figure.
If the income is weekly, total the figures from the last five payslips, divide by 5 to get the average weekly pay, multiply that by 52 to calculate the annual figure, and then divide by 12 to find the equivalent monthly figure.

**Non-cash compensation**
Customers may choose to have their bonus payment paid into alternate places instead of having it paid cash. E.g. their pension or share scheme etc. This can still be used toward affordability when assessing a mortgage application.
Where shares are a feature of an applicant’s total income awarded by their employer (e.g. in the form of restricted stock units (RSU’s) that are subject to a vesting schedule) this cannot be considered standard income in the affordability assessment for retail mortgage applications
### Cladding/The Building Safety Act 2022

The Building Safety Act 2022 provides protection from the remediation costs of replacing external combustible material where there is an agreed approach to remediation in place.

Buildings that have external wall systems may require an EWS1 rating. Where a rating is A3 OR B2 this indicates some form of remediation is required.

There are a variety of options available to leaseholders and Barclays made a commitment to help customers living in or buying impacted properties where there is a qualifying lease or planned remediation in place by a recognised body.

To support applications for impacted properties that require remediation we will need one of the following to be provided to us with your client's mortgage application.

- Written confirmation of intention to complete the works from a developer who has signed a contact with the government. You can see a full list of developers who have signed the pledge on .GOV.UK
- A Building Safety Act 2022 Government Leaseholder Deed of Certificate Form accompanied by a Building Safety Act 2022 Landlords Certificate
- Written confirmation from a housing association confirming they are completing the remediation or written confirmation from DLUHC confirming the property is approved for funding to remediate. For letters from DLUHC, these should clearly state if any financial liability is passed to the leaseholder or be accompanied by a leaseholder or landlord certificate.

Where your client provides the Landlord and Leaseholder certificates it is important to capture the financial commitment they will have. You can find the total sum payable on the landlord certificate within the "work undertaken on relevant defects" section.

Any amount the client must pay will be taken over a 10-year period. Therefore, the amount due on Monday 14th February 2022, should be divided by 120 months and captured as or within the service charge to ensure affordability is met.

Developer or Housing Association remediated properties will have no financial liability passed to the leaseholder and therefore will not impact affordability.

Please note: if the application is for a property that requires fire safety remediation we will only proceed where we have satisfactory evidence in the format/s detailed above. In the event this cannot be provided we would be unable to support your customers mortgage application at this time.

For customers who already hold their mortgage with Barclays against a property that requires remediation we can support rate switch applications, permission to let requests and conversion from BTL to residential or vice versa without evidence being required. Where any additional borrowing is required for existing customers, the rules detailed would apply.
### Commitments – Residential

The monthly amount to be paid towards the following commitments (including those originated and/or operated outside of the UK) must be deducted from the applicant/s net income to prove affordability:

- Hire Purchase Agreements including Mail Order Payments, Bank Loans, Finance Loans, Payday Loan Advances (full amount outstanding applies) or Second Charges
- Future Commitments - commitments that become due during the term of the mortgage must be included in the affordability assessment. This includes deferred credit payments and delayed payments and should be entered in the 'deferred credit' dropdown box on the financial commitments page on the mortgage application system
- In addition to being included in the Special Scheme information in Borrowing Requirements, all Shared Equity loan balances, including England & Wales Help to Buy Equity loans, must be recorded within Financial Commitments under 'Shared Equity' if interest is due within the mortgage term. The system will then take 3% per annum of the outstanding balance of the loan as a commitment for affordability. Please note: only in circumstances where no interest is due on the shared equity loan at any stage within the mortgage term (such as the Scotland HTB equity scheme) or the equity loan is being paid off in full as part of the application, should the equity loan not be recorded as a Financial Commitment If repaying part of an interest charging equity loan, these should be input as two Shared Equity commitments – one for the Shared Equity loan balance to be repaid (marked 'to be repaid') and one for the Shared Equity loan balance to remain (marked 'not to be repaid')
- Second or subsequent properties: commitments in the form of mortgage payments on second properties, other than those on properties confirmed as Buy to Let or Permission to Let properties, will automatically be applied on a standard repayment basis over the outstanding mortgage term at the current affordability rate or current payment amount, whichever is the higher when assessing affordability. Where a credit limit applies to the existing mortgage borrowing, then it is this figure, including any undrawn monies, that should be used when assessing affordability. In addition, a fixed-value commitment for each additional mortgaged residential property held is applied by the system to cover all other costs – this only applies to other residential properties, i.e. second residential homes, but not any property confirmed as being on a Buy to Let or Permission to Let basis.
- Buy to let/ Permission to let properties: Commitments in the form of contractual monthly mortgage payments on background buy to let/ permission to let properties will be applied automatically
- The running costs of any unencumbered second property need to be included in the affordability assessment – please manually enter figures on the Commitments screen. This should include
  - Gas and electricity
  - Water
  - House insurance
  - Council tax
  - Ground rent/service charge
- Guarantors: If a customer is a guarantor for any mortgage, property rental agreement, secured loan or any other loans then the monthly payment of such commitments is applied in the affordability assessment in line with the above requirements
- Regular Pension Payments – including any additional voluntary payments (such as AVCs) being paid regularly from income. One-off contributions – for example from an annual bonus – can be disregarded (pension contributions will be calculated automatically as part of the affordability assessment. They shouldn't be input as part of the application process)
- The cost of any bridging loan
- Court orders relating to maintenance payments or judgement debts
- Child Support Agency (CSA) payments
- School fees and child care costs
- Current monthly student loan payment
- Liability for ground rent, service and maintenance charges under any leasehold, commonhold or other agreement – including any equity sharing agreements
- Credit card debts (at the rate of 3% of the debt outstanding) including store cards
- Overdraft debts (at the rate of 3% of the drawn balance at the time of application)
- Council tax
- Shared equity loan or shared ownership rent
- **Foreign Credit Commitments** - Where a mortgage applicant has any credit commitment denominated in a currency other than GBP, this will be converted to sterling using [Barclays Foreign Note Rate](https://www.barclays.co.uk/travel/foreign-currency-exchange/) including balance and regular payments. This will be completed on the day the initial decision is obtained (i.e DIP 1)

**Other considerations**

- Any loan/fixed repayment debt with less than 6 months to run can be ignored, provided that the total balance of loans in this category does not exceed £1,000
- The total amount outstanding against any 'payday' loan advance must be deducted from the applicant's net income when assessing affordability
- Any commitment which is to be repaid from the new proposed mortgage advance can be ignored provided a specific offer condition is made to this effect
- Any unpaid tax evidenced from the HMRC tax overview document must be treated as a commitment in the period it falls due
- Where an applicant is in receipt of benefit income, please ensure any associated regular costs incurred by the customer – for which this benefit income is intended – is included as a commitment. For example, if the applicant is claiming Personal Independence Payments (PIP), it may be appropriate to record any regular care costs.  

Notes: If any undeclared commitment is identified this will generate a remodelling of the application and potentially a change in lending decision.
### Contract workers

Our policy on applicants who are contractors depends on if they are working on an employed or self-employed basis.

Applicants employed in professional roles where contracts are provided on a fixed term basis, but each contract rolls to the next placement and so the overarching employment does not change (i.e. Junior Doctors, Teachers, Junior Solicitors), should be keyed as employed. These roles will all receive a salary.

**All contractors**

- There can be no more than a 6-week gap between contracts
- Evidence of 12 months' contracts (a minimum of 2 contracts must be provided if latest contract covers <12 months) is required – the only exception is where the applicant has recently moved from employee to contractor and provides services to their previous employer: In this case, we require confirmation that the client employed the applicant for at least 3 years before they became a contractor along with a copy of the service contract showing terms of remuneration, duration of contract and conditions of cancellation or termination
- There must be 3 months remaining on their current contract or alternatively be able to provide evidence of the next one

**Umbrella, Agency or Fixed Term contractors**

The following policy applies to contract workers who are employed on a PAYE basis (e.g. via an umbrella company or agency): Income is calculated on an employed basis using 3 months' (or equivalent) pay slips, and taking an average where necessary, any holiday pay received is included within the average. Where the customer has any form of variable pay or bonus this should be calculated using employed policy.

Applications for contractors in occupations such as professional sport will be assessed on a case-by-case basis to check for sustainability and plausibility. By recording these types of customer on the application as 'Employed - Fixed Term Contract' this will ensure these checks can take place.

**Self-employed contractors**

For contract workers operating on a self-employed basis affordability calculations will depend on how their business is structured. Where ALL of the following additional requirements are met a daily rate calculation may be applied

- The firm is a limited company
- The firm does not employ anyone (other than the applicant(s) themselves)
- The applicant(s) collectively own 100% shares
- The applicant's current contract equates to at least £218 per day or £50,000 per year (gross)
- Mortgage Loan-to-Value is ≤ 90%

**Daily-rate calculation**

To calculate gross income, you will

- Identify the lower of the following – Average Daily Rate of Pay (excl. VAT) from the 2 most recent contracts OR the most recent Daily Rate of Pay (excl. VAT) OR the actual income shown on the bank statements;
- then multiple by 5 and;
- then multiple by 46 to give the annual figure

If the contract expresses pay as an hourly-rate, then the applicant's income should be calculated on the assumption there are a maximum of 40 working hours per week, unless the contract or the applicant specifies a lower number of hours. The resulting weekly amount should then be multiplied by 46 working weeks to arrive at the gross annual income for affordability purposes.

**Additional commitments** (where daily-rate is used) - When the 'daily-rate calculation' is being used; credit commitments for which the limited company is liable/responsible (e.g. business loans, including 'bounce back loans') should be recorded within the application and considered as part of the overall affordability assessment. On the application, the monthly payment should be entered as shown on the business bank statements, the outstanding balance detailed as £1 and the remaining term as 1y 0m.

The following **additional documents** are required if the 'daily-rate calculation' is being applied

- Latest 3 full month's consecutive personal bank statements confirming receipt of income
- Latest 3 full month's consecutive business bank statements confirming receipt of income

All contractors using the daily rate should be recorded on the application as 'Employed - Fixed Term Contract'.

Contractors not employed via an umbrella or agency or that do not meet the daily rate criteria must document income following our self-employed policy. Please refer to our self-employed and allowable income sections for further details.

**Zero Hours**

Zero Hours Contracts may be accepted if there's clear evidence that the applicant's income is stable and meets the required level.
### Credit reference searches

A full personal credit check will be undertaken on each applicant.

### Criteria and Packaging Guide

[Criteria and Packaging Guide](https://intermediaries.uk.barclays/content/dam/intermediaries-uk-barclays/pdf/Criteria_and_Packaging_Guide.pdf "Opens in a new window") [PDF, 757KB].

### Cryptoassets

You should make us aware if any portion of the customer's income or source of wealth is cryptoasset-based or consists of investments in a crypto-related software business (e.g. Blockchain/DLT Tech firms).

Cryptoassets can include cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin), utility tokens (unregulated cryptoassets usually issued as part of an ICO/ITO), asset tokens including 'stable coins' (asset-backed coins with a value pegged to a physical asset of some kind) and security tokens.

Applications of this nature will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

## D-K

### Dependent Relative

Applications for the purchase of residential properties that will be occupied by a dependant relative of the applicant are acceptable under lending standards.

If the property being bought is being sold by a dependant relative who will then remain in the property after the sale takes place, the application must be declined.

Any dependent relative must be disclosed on the application as a financial dependent.

Any dependant relative must be occupying the property rent-free.

Any persons aged 17 or over who are not party to the mortgage but are, or will be, occupying the property during the mortgage term must be declared on the application as an occupier.  

### Deposit

Where a property is being purchased, applicants are expected to provide a deposit of at least 5% of the purchase price

The personal stake may vary depending on specialist schemes or circumstances where loan to value restrictions apply.

The applicants must declare the source and amount of their deposit on the application form. Usually, the deposit will be from the applicants' own savings, the sale of their previous property, a gift from relatives/partner or a combination of these sources.

Barclays consider a relative or partner as the borrower's spouse or civil partner; a person (whether or not of the opposite sex) whose relationship with the borrower has the characteristics of the relationship between husband and wife; or the borrower's parent, brother, sister, child (including stepchild), grandparent or grandchild.

It is not acceptable for applicants to resort to secondary borrowing to fund the deposit, for example, by raising a personal loan. The only exception to this rule is, where the applicant is raising a deposit from the equity in another property.

For all purchase applications the applicant must provide documented proof of the source of the deposit. 
### Diplomatic immunity

Staff working in the UK for embassies, high commissions and international organisations (eg, United Nations) benefit from diplomatic immunity. Mortgage requests from applicants who have diplomatic immunity are outside of lending standards and should be declined.

### Discounted market sales

As part of their affordable housing obligations, local authorities, housing associations and private developers or house builders may offer properties for sale at a discount, set at a percentage of open market value – for example, 80%. This discount may apply in perpetuity which means that, for subsequent sales, the owner must sell the property at the same discount based on the open market value at that time.

The discount arrangement is usually under a 'section 106' restriction. Discounted market sales are acceptable provided this restriction does not apply to the lender who may sell the property at open market value, this is known as a mortgagee in possession clause. The maximum nomination period we accept is 3 months.

Maximum 85% LTV based on the discounted sale price. Where there is a section 106 agreement, the LTV must not exceed 80% of the open market value (not the discounted sale price).

Product availability is based on the full market value.
### Employed Applicants

You'll need to have been in continuous employment for the last three months with no gaps. This doesn't have to be with the same employer, but if you've been with your current employer less than three months, your case will be assessed by the team. They might ask you to provide additional information.

For details of documentary requirements for employed income, please see [Criteria and Packaging Guide](https://intermediaries.uk.barclays/content/dam/intermediaries-uk-barclays/pdf/Criteria_and_Packaging_Guide.pdf "Opens in a new window") [PDF, 756KB].

**Second Job**

100% of income will be accepted if, sustainability is evidenced.

**Employed by relative**

Where an applicant works for a "relative or partner"* who owns more than 20% of the company in which the applicant is employed by, we will treat them as employed, however we must take additional steps to confirm sustainability of income. The last 3 months payslips, corresponding bank statements and latest P60 must be provided. Where there is subsequently any concern with regards to sustainability of income required, underwriters should request trading accounts for the company for the last 2 years, or where employed by an LLP, a letter from the Finance Director/Senior Partner confirming income.

*"Relative or Partner" is defined as "The borrower's spouse or civil partner; a person (whether or not of the opposite sex) whose relationship with the borrower has the characteristics of the relationship between husband and wife; or the borrower's parent, brother, sister, child (including step child), grandparent or grandchild.'
### Family Springboard

The Family Springboard Mortgage is a product designed to allow family members and others to help a loved one get on, or up, the property ladder. Through it 'helpers' provide a 10% security deposit held in a 'Helpful Start' account and applicants are then able to purchase a property with no deposit or a personal deposit starting at just 5%. After 5 years the 10% contribution is released back to the helpers, with interest added (restrictions may apply), and the applicant continues with their mortgage.

- Applications to be submitted with a deposit from 0% to 9.99% (including any application fees)
- LTI at 4.0 times, however, if applications earn over £50,000 individually or collectively this will go up to 4.49 times
- Maximum loan amount of £500,000
- Maximum term of 35 years
- Applies to purchases only, but not restricted to first-time buyers
- Repayment type must be standard capital and interest, ie not interest-only
- Applicants can only be party to 1 Family Springboard Mortgage; however, there is no restriction to the number of Family Springboard mortgages that helpers can support
- Helpers must put 10% of the purchase price into a Helpful Start account. The deposit monies are to be held for a period of 5 years from mortgage completion subject to satisfactory mortgage payment history throughout that period
- A legal charge must be obtained over the Helpful Start account deposit monies before any mortgage monies are released and the deposit account must be frozen for the period required to support the mortgage. While the charge is in place the Helpful Start account is not covered by the Financial Services Compensation scheme
- The Helpful Start account holders must obtain Independent Legal Advice, to be evidenced by Mortgage Services prior to the release of any mortgage monies. The borrower and the Helper may have the same solicitor for the Independent Legal Advice (though this is dependent on the discretion of the solicitor's firm)
- Family Springboard Mortgages are not available on new build properties
- It is unacceptable for Family Springboard applications to be submitted where the property is to be let from the outset; this includes armed forces
- Family Springboard mortgages are not available under the Family Affordability Plan (Joint Borrower/Sole Proprietor policy)
- Family Springboard is not available for shared equity or shared ownership propositions
- No additional borrowing is allowed during the first 5 years or while the security deposit funds are being relied on to support
- Standard policy rules apply with regards to affordability, income multiples and adverse credit
- All applicants must be UK/EU/EEA national OR have permanent rights to reside in the UK – this is to be evidenced, usually by the production of passport documentation.

An applicant cannot apply for a Family Springboard mortgage if they own a BTL property or have a second residential property, even if it is on a Permission to Let basis.
### First-time buyers – Residential

Mortgage applicants must be first-time buyers who haven't previously held a mortgage in the UK or abroad. This applies to all applicants for a joint application.  

### Forces Help to Buy
Service personnel may be offered a Forces Help To Buy Loan (FHTB), which replaces the Long Service Advance of Pay (LSAP). This is usually a 10-year interest-free loan of up to £25,000. This may be used as a deposit to purchase a property but should be treated as a loan commitment in the normal way with the monthly payments being deducted from the applicant’s income.
The sourcing of the deposit in this way must be declared in the mortgage submission, and advisors or underwriters may ask the applicant to provide the ‘Personal Information Note’, which will contain details of their loan.
**Note:** Forces Help to Buy may be used as a deposit to help fund the purchase of a property under the Help to Buy: equity loan, but it cannot be used to help fund a deposit for buying a property through the Help to Buy: mortgage guarantee scheme.
### Green Home Mortgages – Residential

The home must be a new-build and have an energy efficiency rating of 81 or higher, or be a new-build with energy efficiency band A or B. There's no other specific eligibility criteria, and the application process is the same as with any other purchase, but applicants will need one of the following to prove the property's energy efficiency rating

- For fully built properties, a valid Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)
- A valid Predicted Energy Assessment (PEA) certificate if the property is still being built

House builders can verbally confirm the property's energy efficiency rating straight away, and applicants can use this to progress their application. They'll still need to send us an eligible EPC or PEA, and should aim to do this as soon as possible. We won't be able to complete their mortgage without one of these documents.

To find out more, take a look at our lending criteria and our dedicated [new build hub](https://intermediaries.uk.barclays/home/our-products/new-build/)  

### Help to Buy equity loan scheme

Applications for the government's Help to Buy scheme have now closed. Your clients won't be able to access the equity loan from Homes England, and won't be able to complete using a Help to Buy: Equity Loan mortgage.

More information on the Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme can be found here: [www.gov.uk/help-to-buy-equity-loan](http://www.gov.uk/help-to-buy-equity-loan)

### Interest-only mortgages - Residential

The maximum loan to value allowed on an interest-only basis is **75%**.

Where the repayment strategy is the sale of mortgaged property and **LTV ≤50%**, customers are required to have a minimum equity of:

* £300,000 for properties in Greater London
* £250,000 for properties in South East and East Anglia
* £200,000 for properties in all other regions

Where the repayment strategy is the sale of mortgaged property and **LTV >50%**, customers must have a **minimum equity of £500,000** across all regions, and a **maximum age of 70 at maturity** will apply.

The table further below lists the postcodes for each region and equity requirement.

The maximum term for an interest-only mortgage is **25 years** and it must not extend into retirement. Additionally, affordability must be demonstrated no later than **age 70**.

The maximum income multiple applicable to interest-only mortgages is **5.00x** (please see the *Income multiples* section of our lending criteria for full policy details).

There is a minimum income criteria required to be eligible for interest-only borrowing (including part and part borrowing):

* Sole application – the applicant must have a gross income of at least £75,000
* Joint application – one applicant must have a gross income of at least £75,000
* Joint application – where no individual income is over £75,000, joint gross income must be at least £100,000

Income must meet lending standards requirements with regards allowable gross income types i.e. Basic + sustainable allowances + self-employed income.

Given the importance of the minimum income criteria, and to protect your customers, please ensure that the minimum requirements are met – particularly where a customer is at the margins of income threshold.

Debt consolidation is not allowed for existing or new interest-only borrowing. The only exceptions to this being where an existing customer has a drawn mortgage reserve balance and wants to consolidate this, or where a customer wishes to add an ERC to the balance of the mortgage when remortgaging to us from a competitor.

The Barclays Group requires all customers who take an interest-only mortgage to have in place a repayment plan for their loan on completion of the advance. Unless using sale of property to be mortgaged, we require the repayment vehicle to have been in place for **12 months**.

The Barclays Group will consider one, or a combination of the following as acceptable repayment plans for interest-only mortgages:

* An existing endowment policy
* An existing stocks and shares ISA
* An existing (minimum 12 months) share, unit, or investment trust (professionally managed)
* Sale of mortgaged property

Where your client wishes to use any other method of repayment to repay the interest-only amount other than the acceptable repayment plans detailed above, this is not acceptable. While it will be the customer's responsibility to maintain the repayment strategy throughout the term of the mortgage, as a responsible lender, it is important for us to ensure all interest-only mortgages are supported by an acceptable repayment strategy which will be sufficient to cover the interest-only mortgage on maturity.

**Part and Part borrowing** – customers can borrow up to **85% LTV**. The interest only element of the loan must be up to a maximum of **75% LTV**.

In addition, where the repayment strategy is the sale of mortgaged property and **LTV ≤50%**, customers are required to have a minimum equity (including any capital and interest borrowing) of:

* £300,000 for properties in Greater London
* £250,000 for properties in South East and East Anglia
* £200,000 for properties in all other regions

Where the repayment strategy is the sale of mortgaged property and **LTV >50%**, customers must have a minimum equity of £500,000 across all regions, and a maximum age of 70 at maturity will apply.

The table below lists the postcodes for each region and equity requirement.

For example, for a £600,000 property in Greater London (based on the valuation or purchase price – whichever is lower), to meet the equity requirement the customer could borrow maximum of £300,000 on an interest-only basis (50%), and £210,000 on capital and interest repayment (35%). So, the total LTV is **85%**.

**Transactions at Undervalue** – eligibility must be based on the actual purchase price and not the property valuation.

**Existing interest-only customers**
Existing interest-only customers wishing to borrow additional funds or port must meet the current lending standards relating to interest-only. This includes meeting the minimum income threshold. Existing customers who do not meet current lending standards for interest-only would need to switch their repayment type to capital and interest.

**Interest-only repayment vehicles**
We require a plausibility check to be done on all interest-only mortgages as per the assessment guidelines in the table below. This will determine if your client can borrow the required amount on an interest-only basis. Documentary evidence must be submitted with the mortgage application and will be checked as part of the underwriting process.

### Internet bank statements - Residential

If the bank statements are from the internet (i.e. screen shots or print offs from internet banking websites/applications) then they are acceptable if either (1) they have been stamped and certified by the issuing bank or (2) the statements show the sort code, account number and the applicant's full name (or this information can be seen elsewhere and cross-referenced to full bank statements).

## L–N

### Leasehold

The minimum lease term we accept is 70 years.

Where the unexpired term of the lease is less than 70 years but it is confirmed that the lease will be extended as part of the mortgage application, these can be considered on a case-by-case basis.

---

### Leaseholders

If the property is leasehold, please ensure you include any ground rent or estate rent charges within the expenditure field on the mortgage calculator and ensure it is included within the mortgage application.

In the event the freehold is also owned by the leaseholder, then we would not be able to provide a mortgage to them. However, we may accept applications where the freehold is owned by a limited company where the leaseholder is a named shareholder/director.

**Minimum Leasehold Terms**

The minimum lease term we accept is 70 years at the point of application. Where the lease is under 70 years at the point of application, these will only be considered where the lease is being extended within the mortgage transaction and any offer would include a condition to ensure the lease is extended by the legal representatives for the application.

---

### Loan purpose

Lending can be for any purpose except for the purchase of a timeshare, business-related lending, funding of any stock market trading, gambling, or to make monthly mortgage payments.

No discretion applies to this area.

### Loan to Value (LTV) - Residential

The loan amount used in the loan to value (LTV) calculation is the aggregate amount borrowed (including reserve) and the valuation is the lower of the purchase price and the valuation obtained.

The following maximum LTV criteria apply; lowest LTV takes precedent:

**Notes:**

* Product availability for transactions at undervalue or where there is a builder/vendor deposit is based on the full market value.
* When calculating LTV, the aggregate loan amount used should not include the capitalised Barclays product fee applicable to that application.
* The affordability assessment and lending for income multiples are to be based on the total advance including the addition of any fees.
* Where the loan size is > £5m, underwriters retain discretion to reduce the maximum LTV based on individual circumstances.

---

### Mixed-use properties - Residential

A property is classified as ‘mixed use’ if there is any element of commercial use – i.e. it is used in part for non-residential purposes, such as a shop, doctor’s surgery, or office. This includes situations where the property itself is wholly residential but there is a commercial use of adjoining/surrounding buildings or land included in the mortgage security – such as stables or sub-let cottages.

The decision to lend will be based on:

* Whether or not the property is identifiable as a residence
* Whether or not the property is saleable as a residence
* Whether the property is classified as residential under planning legislation
* The value of the property as a residence

All mixed-use properties fall outside of standard policy and will be assessed by an underwriter on their individual merits.

In all cases, the local authority planning classification must be solely residential.

Please note that properties classed as ‘Live/Work Units’ are not acceptable for either Buy to Let or Residential lending.

At least 40% of the property must be used as the applicant’s main residence, and the remainder must be used exclusively by the applicant for their own business purposes.

Mixed-use properties are limited to 80% LTV, and certain commercial uses will not be considered:

* Fast food or sandwich shops
* Care homes
* Kennels
* Catteries
* Caravan parks
* Working farms

Mixed-use properties are not acceptable for Shared Ownership/Equity nor Buy to Let.

Further standard lending conditions will apply to mixed-use properties. Please refer to our lending criteria pages for more details.

### Mortgage Boost (Joint borrower / Sole proprietor)

Mortgage Boost (Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor) is a proposition that lets you be named as a mortgage applicant, even if you’re not also a legal owner of the property.

**Conditions**

* Available in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland
* All proprietors must also be borrowers
* All non-proprietor borrowers who live (or will live) in the mortgaged property must sign an occupancy form
* All non-proprietors must take independent legal advice, evidenced by a solicitor’s letter
* Where the proprietor has an existing residential property that isn’t being sold, the maximum LTV is 90% (residential only)
* All other standard LTV limits apply
* All borrowers must sign the property’s mortgage deeds

**Exclusions**

* Not available on Family Springboard, Right to Buy, First Home Fund, or Help to Buy schemes

**Criteria**

This facility is available for Barclays Residential Mortgages and Openplan Offset products via all channels. In cases where this arrangement is required, the following must be adhered to:

* The applicants must clearly state the requirement for this arrangement and the name of the sole property owner on the application form in the ‘Additional information’ section
* The borrower who is not named on the title should sign an occupancy form if living in the property
* All borrowers must sign the mortgage deed
* It is mandatory that any borrower(s) not named on the title to the property obtain independent legal advice. This must be confirmed to Mortgage Services by the solicitor providing the advice before completion monies are released
* Joint Borrower/Sole Proprietor is not available with Help to Buy
* This arrangement can only be made where one of the joint borrowers is not also a legal estate holder (i.e. will not be on the title deeds). Under no circumstances can a mortgage be agreed where any party named on the title deeds is not also going to be a mortgage borrower

**Notes:**

* If the non-proprietor has any existing residential mortgage commitments (not BTL/PTL), these must be taken into account in the affordability assessment. Calculations should be made on a standard repayment basis over the remaining mortgage term at the current pay rate or stressed rate, whichever is higher
* Products under the NewBuy scheme allowing the maximum LTV to be increased to 95% on new build purchases in England for specific participating builders are available under this borrowing structure for the purchase of the principal residence of named occupier(s)

For intermediary use only.

### New build properties - Residential

For Residential and BTL lending purposes, a new build is defined as a property first registered two or fewer years ago and subject to first sale by the developer, regardless of time or rental use in the interim. This may include a new construction, conversion, or renovation from an earlier use.

**Builder’s deposit and incentives**

Builder financial incentives are acceptable provided the incentive does not have to be repaid and the builder/developer does not intend to register a charge against the property.

It is acceptable for financial incentives to be used towards funding the deposit, provided the borrower is funding at least 5% of the purchase price from their own funds (this may include a gift from a relative).

Where the combined value of any financial incentives exceeds 5% of the valuation (or purchase price where lower), the amount exceeding 5% will be deducted from the valuation (or purchase price where lower) for the purposes of calculating the maximum loan amount.

**Example (new build house):**

| Description                       | Amount                      |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Lower of valuation/purchase price | £200,000                    |
| Builder cash incentive            | £22,000 (11% of value)      |
| Incentive amount exceeding 5%     | £12,000                     |
| Adjusted valuation                | £188,000                    |
| Maximum loan                      | £169,200 (90% of £188,000)* |

*Refer to current criteria for the prevailing maximum LTV.

Upgrades forming an integral part of the property are not counted toward the 5% cash incentive threshold. Examples include:

* White goods (where not standard)
* Floor coverings
* Integrated lighting
* Kitchen/bathroom upgrades
* Electrical upgrades
* PV panels
* Turfing/landscaping

All incentives must be declared to the valuer using the UK Finance Disclosure Form.

---

**Offer validity**

Mortgage offers are valid for six months from application date.
If completion takes longer (e.g. off-plan purchases), we can usually extend the offer another six months with confirmation that circumstances haven’t changed significantly. A new credit search will be conducted.

If significant changes have occurred, full re-underwriting may be required.

---

**Second properties**

If a customer already owns a property (and isn’t selling it), the maximum LTV is 90%. Under schemes like Help to Buy, customers cannot buy a new property if they own another property.

---

**Sub-sales and sale contract reassignments**

Acceptable if:

* Valuer is aware of transaction type
* LTV < 70% of purchase price or valuation (whichever is lower)
* Lending < contracted sale price to third party
* Deposit is from own resources or gifted from relatives
* No relationship exists between seller, buyer, and third party

---

**Acceptable warranties include:**

ABC+, Advantage (CGICE only), ARK, Build Assure, Build-Zone, CADIS, Checkmate Castle 10, Global Home Warranties, Protek, Home Proof, ICW, LABC, NHBC, One Guarantee, Premier Guarantee, Q Policy/Q Assure.

CRL (no longer trading): Policies backed by Casualty & General or ARK remain acceptable.
BLP: Policies underwritten by AGCS up to 27 Nov 2020 are acceptable.
Retrospective warranties and PCCs are not acceptable.

---

**Professional Consultant Certificates (PCCs)**

PCCs are only acceptable if:

* Signed by a qualified professional with appropriate indemnity insurance
* In the exact UK Finance Lender Handbook format
* Not retrospective
* Scheme ≤ 5 properties (max 10 by exception with approval)
* Not used for flats or large developments

---

### Number of applicants

The maximum number of borrowers is 4.
For 3 or more applicants, only the 2 highest incomes are used for affordability and income multiple calculations. All financial commitments from all applicants are included in affordability.

Only 2 borrowers are allowed for Openplan Offset Mortgages.

---

## O-Q

### Offer validity

A mortgage offer is valid for a 6-month period from the date the mortgage application is received by our teams.

Any offer that does not complete within this period must be re-submitted as a new application with the exception of 'New Build Purchase' applications which can be assessed against current lending standards with a refreshed credit search and re-offered for a further period of 6 months with the existing product or a product from the current range.

This is subject to receiving confirmation that there has been no material change to the customer(s) circumstances since the original application was submitted using the New Build Mortgage Offer Extension Declaration form. If there has been a material change, the application will be fully re-assessed against current lending standards.

An updated valuation should be requested in all scenarios with the exception of where the tolerance, referred to below, applies and for 'New Build Purchase' applications where the original valuation will be accepted. Any subsequent extension requirement will be subject to full re-submission.

The valuation validity period aligns with the offer validity period of 6 months from submission with the exception of 'New Build Purchase' applications which are re-offered for a further period of 6 months with the valuation validity aligned to the new offer validity period.

Where notice has been given that the proposed property has fallen through and a new property found, a new application must be submitted unless purchase price and mortgage amount are all unchanged and completion is anticipated within 6 months of the original submission. A product will need to be selected from the current range available unless the original product remains available.

For non new build purchase and remortgage we also offer 2 week extension

Applications can only be extended once and a new offer will be produced for the solicitor so they can proceed with the completion.
### Overage

Overage is an agreement in which the seller can obtain a portion of the future value of a property. This increase in value can be attributed to a future development. Where a property is sold to a buyer, and it's worth more when the property is sold on, the seller may be entitled to claim back some of the difference in sales prices. For this to happen, the value needs to have increased for one of the reasons set out in the overage deed – for example, the land has planning permission.

'-Negative-' overage can apply where the buyer covenants with the vendor on the sale of the property that, eg, no development will take place on the property that the vendor does not permit or without the vendor's consent.

To ensure the vendor gets the benefit of the overage payment the deed is usually secured by any or all of the following methods: a charge or restriction secured against the property, a direct deed of covenant or a guarantee.

They are usually very complicated arrangements and are have sometimes been found to contain defective drafting.

**It is not acceptable to lend to new customers where there is an existing Overage agreement or where it is intended to create one on completion of the purchase/re-mortgage.**
### Overpayments and Rate Switch Journey

Where a customer has made overpayments, it is important you look at both section 3 and 6 of the ESIS document.

Section 3 will include the balance after any overpayments have been accounted for.

In section 6 you will see the current outstanding balance without overpayments being considered. For this reason, the balance will be higher in section 6 if overpayments have been made.

The monthly payment figure is based on the full outstanding balance (this is before any overpayment is considered). When the rate switch has completed the customer will be sent a letter which will advise of the monthly payment considering any overpayment balance.

Customers can choose to apply their overpayments to the mortgage balance outstanding, but it is important to check if any early repayment charges would apply.

See images below for further clarity:

**Section 3 of the ESIS**

Note: This is the section showing the balance with over payments taking into account.

**Section 6 of the ESIS**

Note: Here the mortgage balance is higher as the customer has an overpayment balance of £6846 which is not being taken into account and why the balance is different between this section and section 3. The monthly payment value is based on this higher balance but there is no need to query this with us and you can advise your customer they will receive a letter that details the monthly payment after their rate is changed which will be a lower figure as it will take into account the overpayments held.

Note: Per Annum is the twelvemonth period from the end date of the product. For example, a rate which is fixed until 30 April 2014 - the scheme end date is 30/04/2014 therefore the annual period runs backwards from 30/04/2014 to 01/05/2013, 30/04/2013 to 01/05/2012 etc.
### Permission to let

Your clients can apply for permission to let if they're looking to move away from a property temporarily and let it out, for example, if they're relocating for work or are a member of the armed forces. Before they apply, they'll need to meet these conditions

- Their mortgage account needs to be up to date, with no arrears. We'll also check whether they've made payments on time for the last six months
- They'll need to let out their property using a tenancy agreement we accept, like an assured shorthold tenancy
- They can't let out their property on more than one tenancy agreement

If we give your client consent to let their home, there will be some new conditions for their mortgage during the tenancy agreement

- They can't apply to borrow more against the property, though we might consider this if they need the money to improve or repair the property
- They need to tell their buildings and contents insurance provider about their new mortgage agreement, as it might affect their cover
- Your clients will need to contact us directly to discuss switching rates or making any other changes to the mortgage while they have permission to let. Please don't submit this type of application

We offer additional options if your clients want to let their property. See 'Short-term letting' for more information.
### Porting - Residential

Porting allows mortgage customers to carry forward ('port') their existing mortgage product, including the interest rate and any Early Repayment Change (ERC) conditions, to a new mortgage.

Existing customers can port when they are redeeming their existing mortgage and purchasing a new property (moving home). Please note it is not possible to port a product onto a property that the customer already owns.

**Criteria**

- Porting must take place either at the time the customer redeems the mortgage product they wish to port and completes on a new mortgage or within 90 days of redemption of the previous mortgage
- Any additional borrowing required must be taken out on a product that is available at the time of porting.
- Customers moving home who incur an Early Repayment Charge (ERC) on full redemption will have any ERCs refunded as long as they port their existing product, complete at the same time or within 90 days of redemption and the new mortgage is for at least 75% of their redeemed balance
- Ported applications that fail to complete within 90 days of redemption, will need to be updated to a non-ported case on a new product available at the time, and any ERC arising from the original product will not be refunded.
- **Reduced Borrowing** – A reduction in borrowing of up to 25% is allowed without incurring any Early Repayment Charges.
- Where a reduction in borrowing is above 25%, an ERC will be payable on the amount above 25%.
- **Porting an Offset Mortgage** – Customers moving home who do not require any additional borrowing are able to port in the normal way. Customers requiring additional borrowing can either select an Offset product from the current range for the total loan amount required, or they may port their loan balance to a Ported Tracker at their existing interest rate and then take any additional borrowing on a product from the current range.
- **Mortgage Current Account Reserves** – Some customers may have a Mortgage Current Account Reserve. These are not portable and if there are any drawn funds at the time of redemption they must be repaid. A new Reserve will not be offered on the customer's new mortgage.

**Like for like porting** - Where an existing mortgage customer wishes to port their mortgage to a new property on a "like for like" (or reduced) basis and the lending proposition is outside of current lending standards, including affordability and "score", such requests can be considered provided:

- There is no increase to the current borrowing amount outstanding
- There is no increase in the term of the current mortgage
- All parties to the current mortgage remain unchanged
- There is no arrears history within the last 12 months on the current mortgage (with the exception of technical arrears)

**Note:** Customers may not port their mortgage product where Permission to Let has been granted.

**Help to Buy and Family Springboard**

Our Help to Buy and Family Springboard products are **not** portable. However, customers will have their Early Repayment Charge (ERC) refunded if they repay the existing mortgage in full and request an equivalent Barclays residential mortgage product to purchase their new property. Please contact 0345 073 3330 for support obtaining this.

Each request is subject to application and must meet our standard lending policy, as well as the following

- The new mortgage must be at least 75% of the existing mortgage balance on the day it's paid off
- Where the sale and purchase do not happen simultaneously, the new mortgage must complete within 90 days of the existing mortgage being paid off
### Property types - Residential

There are some property types which are not deemed suitable security for the Barclays Group and so in all cases lending will be declined. These scenarios are listed below:

- Demolish and rebuilds
- Freehold flats and maisonettes
- Properties classed as 'houses in multiple occupation' where a licence from the Local Authority is required
- Live-work units

Some properties may have certain features which mean that extra care will have to be taken. In these cases please contact the Intermediary Support Team for further details on our lending policy:

- Contaminated land – typically from previous industrial use of the site
- Adjoining flats (granny annexe) – each case will be looked at individually
- Japanese Knotweed – Japanese Knotweed would be assessed by a valuer following [RICS guidance](https://www.rics.org/content/dam/ricsglobal/documents/standards/Japanese%20knotweed_October%202022.pdf "Opens in a new window"). If an invasive weed outbreak is present, it must be treated. The treatment should be carried out by a reputable contractor who is part of a registered body. Payment must be made in full upfront, or funds should be held back until completion. Additionally, a valid insurance-backed, transferable 10-year guarantee must be in place upon completion. This guarantee is required before or at the commencement of treatment.
- Agricultural restrictions – our policy position will depend on the extent of the restrictions
- Modern methods of construction – will require an individual assessment by a valuer
- Flats over shops/commercial premises – each case will be looked at individually
- High-rise blocks of flats/ Deck Access - Properties with deck area access can only be considered for good quality developments with no restriction whatsoever on mortgageability/saleability. Properties that have non-decorative timber cladding will be looked at individually.
- Mixed-use properties – please see 'Mixed-Use policy' page
- Section 106 properties- each case will be looked at individually depending on section 106 requirements. Please refer to S.106 agreement (S.75 in Scotland)
- Early steel frame construction – not normally considered suitable security but may be looked at by a surveyor if a Structural Engineer's Report is obtained. Please contact the Intermediary Support Team for extra information

The above lists are not exhaustive. Please contact the Intermediary Support Team for further details.

## R–Z

### Reduced income for defined period of time

When an applicant is currently on, or is about to start, a period of reduced income for a defined period of time (e.g. maternity, paternity, adoption leave), we’ll base the affordability and overall lending assessment on their ‘return to work’ income details.

To verify their income, please provide all the following:

* Their latest payslip
* Their last payslip before the period of reduced income, if they have already started a period of reduced income
* Their return-to-work details. As a minimum this must include:

  * Intended return date
  * Proposed basic income on return
  * If the applicant is working hourly, the proposed number of hours to be worked on their return
  * If the applicant intends to amend their working hours, confirmation that their employer has approved this

---

### Rent to Own

The Rent to Own scheme allows participants to rent a home from a Housing Association/Registered Social Landlord (RSL)/Housebuilders and have the option to purchase the property after an initial period.

Upon exercising the option to purchase, the Housing Association/RSL/Housebuilders will gift the tenant a portion of the rent paid and, in the case of the Welsh Rent-to-Own scheme, 50% of the uplift in market value of the property (as determined by a landlord-appointed RICS valuer).

Barclays will accept these funds as part of the deposit – standard policy applies.

Applicants may also have the option to purchase their home on a Shared Ownership basis and in these cases standard Shared Ownership policy applies.

There can be no restriction on resale.

---

### Reserves

Mortgage Reserves are no longer available for new mortgage applications, be they Offset or Non-Offset. Customers may still have a pre-existing Mortgage Reserve that they can use but increases to this aren’t available.

Flexible mortgage customers requiring additional borrowing:

Customers are able to apply for a further advance.

Offset customer(s) requiring additional borrowing will be able to either:

* Apply for a remortgage, selecting an Offset product from the current product range for the total loan amount required
* Apply for a remortgage to port their existing main mortgage balance to a Ported Tracker at the same interest rate, with additional borrowing taken on a product from our current range

Offset customer(s) moving home and requiring additional borrowing on their main mortgage will be able to either:

* Apply for a new Offset product from the current product range for the total loan amount required
* Apply for a new loan porting their existing main mortgage balance to a Ported Tracker at the same interest rate, with additional borrowing taken on a product from our current range

In all of the scenarios above, any applicable early repayment charge on the existing Offset mortgage will be waived (although other fees may apply, e.g. an administration fee).

Please note: Our interest-only limit product maximum LTV applies across the mortgage and any reserve that the customer might have.

---

### Residency - Residential

All mortgage applications will be assessed in terms of length of time living in the UK and rights to reside. There will potentially be further checks dependent on the application LTV.

| Living in the UK for more than 1 year                                                                                                              | Living in the UK for less than 1 year                                              |                                                                                                          |

### Right to Buy

We are happy to assist with the purchase of your client’s property under the Right to Buy (RTB) and Voluntary Right to Buy (VRTB) schemes, providing they meet our standard lending policy.

Our main criteria for RTB are:

* We can lend up to 100% of the discounted price as long as this does not exceed 90% of the valuer’s open market valuation
* For loan amounts above £640k for houses and £310k for flats we can lend up to 85% of the discounted price as long as this does not exceed 80% of the valuer’s open market valuation
* Enhanced income multiples can be applied where an appropriate credit score is achieved
* Only the individual(s) entitled to the RTB may apply
* Remortgages will be considered subject to certain criteria. Contact our IBC for guidance

Please note that:

* Our charge must rank in priority to any charge registered by the Local Authority
* A product must be selected using the full market value of the property, not the discounted price
* Flexible mortgages are available but the Reserve will always be set to nil
* Application fees can be added to the mortgage advance providing the total borrowing does not exceed 100% of the discounted price
* We’ll need a Deed of Postponement (DoP) for Voluntary Right to Buy applications
* For full loan-to-value detail please check Loan-to-Value (LTV) Residential
* Applicants who do not have permanent rights to reside in the UK are not eligible to apply

All applications are to be submitted on a full-status basis. In addition to the supporting documentation required as per our requirements tables, your client will need to provide a copy of the letter from their landlord/local authority confirming the details of their RTB offer.

Product availability is based on the full market value.

### Scottish valuations

In Scotland, we will attempt to generate an Automated Valuation (AVM) for properties that fit the Barclays criteria. We will alternatively accept a transcript of the Mortgage Valuation provided as part of the Single Survey report (when the customer wishes to use one), as long as the surveyors are on the Barclays panel. However, AVMs or transcripts do not apply to Scottish New Build properties where we will instruct a valuation as part of the mortgage application process (a survey fee will be payable only for properties above the £2M threshold; please see our Tariff of Charges for further details).

For more information on Barclays approved surveyors in Scotland please contact 0345 073 3330*.

**Scottish Surveyor Panel List**

Please see the list below for the Scottish Surveyors who are on our approved panel.

**Barclays Panel List**

* e.surv
* Connells
* J&E Shepherd
* Allied (Scotland)
* Graham & Sibbald
* Walker Fraser & Steele
* D M Hall
* Harvey Donaldson & Gibson

Note: In Scotland it is essential the home report is dated within the last 90 days prior to the application being submitted in order to be acceptable.

---

### Second/subsequent charges

When a second/subsequent charge is secured against the subject property, you should provide us with the following information:

* Second/subsequent chargee name
* Second/subsequent chargee address
* Account/reference number
* Confirmation of whether the charge will be repaid with the proceeds of the mortgage
* If there is a cost to the applicant associated with the charge (for example, it relates to a secured loan) this must also be recorded in the application as a commitment

If the charge will not be repaid before/upon completion we will require a Deed of Postponement (DoP) prior to release of funds.

If the charge will be repaid in full upon completion, solicitors must control the funds advanced and ensure the second charge is discharged. The legal costs associated with this will be at the applicant’s expense.

---

### Self-build mortgages

No new mortgages will be accepted at the present time on self-build mortgages or stage payment projects. This includes demolish and rebuild scenarios.

---

### Self-employed

Applicants are classed as self-employed when they hold over a 20% share in a company.

For details of documentary requirements for self-employed, please see [Criteria and Packaging Guide](https://intermediaries.uk.barclays/content/dam/intermediaries-uk-barclays/pdf/Criteria_and_Packaging_Guide.pdf "Opens in a new window") [PDF, 757KB].

PAT (Profit after tax)

Profit, after any applicable corporation tax has been deducted, can be considered towards the affordability assessment, in addition to the applicant’s director’s salary where applicable, where the following requirements are met:

* The total loan amount (less capitalised product fees, and including any existing Barclays mortgage borrowing on the same property) is over or equal to £700k (for Residential applications) or £600k (for Buy to Let applications). Where the loan amount is below these thresholds the affordability assessment will be based on the applicant’s director’s salary and dividends only. PAT cannot be taken into consideration.
* The borrower(s) collectively own greater than 50% of the company’s shares.

The maximum amount of Limited Company PAT that can be considered as part of the overall affordability assessment is the lower of:

* 100% of the three-year average Limited Company PAT, or
* 100% of the Limited Company PAT for the latest trading year

The amount of PAT used will be determined by the percentage shareholding of the applicant. For example, where the borrower is a 70% shareholder, a maximum of 70% of PAT can be considered.

For applicants that have received a loan from the company that remains outstanding at the point of application, 2.25% of the outstanding balance (as evidenced by an accountant’s letter) should be calculated and then 1/12 of this figure captured as a monthly commitment within the affordability assessment. Details needed for the accountant’s letter can be found in ‘Useful Documents’ under ‘Limited Company Profit After Tax’.

For more information, please refer to the Limited Company Profit After Tax form.

### Shared equity

Under shared equity schemes, the customer owns the property outright, usually with the right to pay off the equity loan in parts. In shared ownership schemes, the customer only owns a share in the property. The customer pays for the property by way of:

* A conventional mortgage
* A deposit from their own resources
* A "loan" provided by the Scheme Provider, referred to as an equity loan, which should be recorded as a commitment

The applicant must be funding at least **25%** of the purchase price of the property by way of mortgage and their own resources. Applications of up to **85%** are acceptable. Applications must be on a standard repayment basis (i.e. not interest only).

The applicant must provide a **minimum 5% deposit** from their own resources – this may include a family gift.

The equity loan term must be the same or longer than the mortgage term agreed. For Help to Buy Equity Loans, the equity loan term can be stated as shorter than the mortgage term, as it will be extended in line with the first charge.

Barclays UK must be able to take a **first legal charge** prior to any charge registered by the Scheme Provider.

---

**Additional Borrowing**
Can be considered providing Scheme Provider permission is obtained and all areas of this section of Lending Guidelines are met:

| Scenario                                                                                                  | Maximum LTV         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Capital raising to repay equity loan in FULL                                                              | 85% of market value |
| Capital raising to buy out co-owners share or partially repay equity loan                                 | 85% of market value |
| Debt consolidation (repayment of the equity loan is not considered debt consolidation for these purposes) | 80% of market value |

**Notes:**

* Product availability is based on the full market value. Please see the loan to value section; lowest LTV takes precedent.
* The equity loan will usually be a percentage of the current market value.
* Permission to Let is not to be considered unless there is specific agreement from the Shared Equity Scheme Provider.
* Any fee/interest payment (current or deferred) associated with the equity loan must be included as a commitment in the affordability assessment.

---

**Scottish Government Schemes:**
Barclays supports the following Scottish Government schemes:

**First Home Fund**
This scheme aims to help first-time buyers in Scotland buy their own home. It provides an interest-free equity loan of up to £25,000 or 49% of the purchase price.

* Available for new-build and second-hand properties
* At least one applicant must be a first-time buyer
* Minimum 5% deposit from own resources
* Total LTV must not exceed 85%
* The minimum mortgage amount is 25% of the purchase price
* The entire mortgage must be on a capital and interest repayment basis

**Additional Borrowing**
Can be considered providing Scheme Provider permission is obtained, where required, and all areas of this section of Lending Guidelines are met:

| Scenario                                                                                                  | Maximum LTV         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Capital raising to repay equity loan in FULL                                                              | 85% of market value |
| Capital raising to buy out co-owners share or partially repay equity loan                                 | 85% of market value |
| Debt consolidation (repayment of the equity loan is not considered debt consolidation for these purposes) | 80% of market value |

**Notes:**

* Product availability is based on the full market value.
* Please see the loan to value section; lowest LTV takes precedent.
* Permission to Let is not to be considered unless there is specific agreement from the Shared Equity Scheme Provider.

**Open Market Shared Equity Scheme (LIFT)**

* Available to first-time buyers to assist with the purchase of existing properties on the market
* Standard shared equity requirements as described above are to apply
* In certain cases, the Scottish Government will retain a small share, referred to as a “Golden Share”, of a property (10%-20%) to prevent full staircasing in areas where first-time buyers find it difficult to purchase properties – e.g. the Highlands where there are few new properties built. This would then allow the government to have first refusal on purchasing the property back at full market price

**New Supply Shared Equity Scheme**

* Available to first-time buyers to assist with the purchase of new build properties
* As with the above open market scheme, standard shared equity requirements apply in addition to acceptance of “Golden Share” where this applies

**Help to Buy Scotland**

* Please refer to the Help to Buy section

---

### Shared ownership

Under shared ownership schemes, the customer part-owns and part-rents the property from the Scheme Provider under the terms of a shared ownership lease. With shared ownership, the applicant must be buying a minimum 25% share of the property.

Purchase applications of up to **90%** (subject to product availability) of the discounted purchase price/share of the property being acquired are acceptable, with any balance being funded from the applicant's own resources.

* Applications must be on a standard repayment basis (i.e. not interest only)
* Providers and landlords must be registered and regulated by the Homes and Communities Agency in order for their schemes to be acceptable
* Barclays Group must be able to take a first legal charge against the customer's leasehold interest in the property and consent given in the usual way for any second charge
* It is unacceptable for restrictions to be placed on resale of the property, except where these comprise the Scheme Provider having an option to buy back the customer's share in the property at the full market value for a maximum period of 3 months. If the Scheme Provider does not wish to exercise the option to buy back, the lender can staircase to 100% (if necessary) and otherwise sell the property on the open market without further restriction, provided the operation of such resale provisions does not prejudice the mortgagee protection provisions in the lease.
* Borrowing must be by way of a Barclays Residential Mortgage product
* The lease should be in the standard form produced by the Homes and Communities Agency incorporating a Mortgage Protection Clause

**Additional Borrowing**
Can be considered where consent has been obtained from the scheme provider to purchase an additional share in the property, provided we are not lending above 85% of the current market value of the share which the customer will own after staircasing.

**Re-mortgages**
Re-mortgages from another lender are acceptable provided agreement from the scheme provider is obtained and all areas of this section of lending guidelines are met (i.e. the new mortgage should be for the same amount, unless staircasing or additional borrowing is required to buy out a co-owner).

**Notes:**

* Products under the NewBuy and Help to Buy schemes are not available for any Shared Ownership proposition.
* If the scheme does not meet all the above criteria then Barclays will not lend.

### Supporting documentation - Residential

Depending on the circumstances of your client's application, supporting documents may be required for the mortgage to be assessed and underwritten. By providing the documentation we need at the outset, you'll help make the experience for you and your client as smooth and efficient as possible.

Submitting applications via MAX will enable us to provide the best possible service.

For details of documentary requirements for employed income, please see [Criteria and Packaging Guide](https://intermediaries.uk.barclays/content/dam/intermediaries-uk-barclays/pdf/Criteria_and_Packaging_Guide.pdf "Opens in a new window") [PDF, 757KB].

### Short-term letting

People who have residential mortgages with us can let out their property, or part of it (for example, a room or an annexe), using short-term letting platforms we've approved. They don't have to get permission from us, as long as:

* They use an online short-term occupancy platform that's on our approved list (see below)
* They agree the occupation under license and not using a tenancy agreement
* The property isn't occupied by someone other than the owner for longer than 90 days in any 12-calendar month period, and for no longer than 30 days consecutively by anyone other than the owner
* Their buildings insurance is always valid
* They aren't breaching any requirements or regulations of local and other relevant authorities
* For special schemes (e.g. Help to Buy or shared ownership) they might need to get permission from the scheme provider before letting out any of their property. They might also need consent from any second charge lenders

**Online short-term occupancy platforms we accept:**

* Airbnb

You should let your client know that we'll still send correspondence to the property if they chose it as their correspondence address, even if it's being rented out.

Rental income from renting out this property or part of it (for example, using a short-term letting arrangement) can't be considered for affordability. It should be deducted from the overall amount of rental income an applicant provides evidence of.

We offer additional options if your clients want to let their property. See *Permission to Let* for more information.

### S.106 agreement (S.75 in Scotland)

The valuer must be able to value the property on a residential basis ignoring any possible business usage.

Right to buy pre-emption clauses giving the council first rights for an onward sale within the first 10 years are acceptable.

If the valuation is satisfactory then the property will constitute suitable security if **all** of the following requirements are also met:

* The maximum LTV is the lower of 80% of the open market value or 85% of the purchase price.
* S.106 agreements must contain a mortgage exclusion clause to protect the mortgage in the event that the registered provider defaults.

**Restrictions on re-sale/disposal**
The S.106 agreement may stipulate that the Local Authority has the right to nominate a buyer (meeting defined eligibility requirements) when the property is sold or disposed of.

Discount market sales will typically have a S.106 present to ensure the discount remains for future sales; these are acceptable provided there is a mortgage in possession clause.

Where the restriction includes a nomination period, these are acceptable provided the nomination period is no more than 3 months.

---

### Term of mortgage - Residential

For new interest-only mortgage customers, the term can't extend into retirement.

Our usual mortgage term is between **5 and 40 years** (25 for interest-only, including part and part).

Certain products also have specific requirements around their maximum mortgage term – for example, Family Springboard. See *Lending products* for more details about specific products.

---

### Transaction under value

Transactions at undervalue can occur where a property is being or has been acquired by way of a Deed of Gift, or for less than the full market value.

For such a transaction to be acceptable to Barclays, the vendor must be a relative of the applicant or the applicant's landlord.

Where an advisor is aware that a mortgage request is to be a transaction at undervalue, Mortgage Services must be notified at initial application stage to ensure the scenario is acceptable based on the above relationship requirements.

In such cases, problems may arise under the Insolvency Act 1986. Under Section 339, a trustee in bankruptcy has the right to apply to the Courts to set aside a transaction at an undervalue if the transferor subsequently becomes bankrupt within 5 years of the date of the transfer.

The period during which the transfer can be set aside is reduced to 2 years if a Declaration of Solvency is obtained at the time of the transfer and the transferor does not become insolvent as a result of the transaction.

Where it is confirmed that the applicant is purchasing their property at an undervalue as defined above, a **minimum deposit of 5%** (based on the lower of valuation or discounted purchase price) must be provided from the applicant's own resources.

It must be confirmed that the property being bought is not that being sold by a dependant relative who will then remain in the property after the sale takes place. If this is the case, then the application must be declined.

The above deposit requirement does not apply to **Springboard Mortgage** transactions where a minimum 5% deposit is required (based on lower of valuation and discounted purchase price), with a further 10% cash deposit to be held in line with standard requirements applicable to a Springboard Mortgage Product.

---

### Valuation appeals

Customers can appeal against valuations where the following apply:

* For remortgages and further advance cases, where there is more than a **25% variance** between the customer's estimated value and the actual valuation provided by the Bank's nominated valuer.
* For purchase cases, where there is a **variance of more than 10%** between the purchase price and the valuation.

This applies to both Residential and Buy to Let cases.

Appeals can only be considered when submitted against a **physical valuation (i.e. not an AVM)**.

If your customer wishes to appeal the valuation in line with the guidance above, you will need to contact your **Barclays Support Team** or email [brokersupport@barclays.com](mailto:brokersupport@barclays.com).

An appeals form will be issued, and you will be required to supply **three comparable properties sold in the last six months**.

### Valuations - Residential

To be able to lend on a property, Barclays requires a valuation to be carried out.

When you apply for a Barclays mortgage, the valuation type depends on whether your mortgage will be on a residential or Buy to Let basis.

The mortgage valuation is our standard report for all residential applications and includes:

* A description of the property
* An opinion of the market value of the property as at the date of inspection
* An estimate of the current cost to reinstate the property in its present form (where appropriate)

It's important to remember that the mortgage valuation is a report primarily for Barclays' purposes and confirms whether the property is suitable security for a mortgage – it is **not a survey**.

We recommend that all clients consider instructing a separate survey for a more detailed assessment of the condition of the property, especially when an AVM has been accepted for lending purposes.

Your client may wish to contact:

* **Countrywide Surveying Services** – 0800 012 6995
* **e.surv Chartered Surveyors** – 0800 169 9661
* Or any other provider

More information on survey types can be found on the *Home Surveys* section of the [Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)](https://www.rics.org/uk/upholding-professional-standards/sector-standards/building-surveying/home-surveys/ "Opens in a new window") website.

Please note that if your clients do instruct their own survey, this will be a separate contract between them and their chosen survey provider, with separate fees applying. Barclays will always rely on the mortgage valuation for the purpose of agreeing the mortgage.

**Automated Valuation Model (AVM)**

For remortgages on properties:

* Up to £1m in value (up to £2m in London and South East), where LTV is 80% or less (subject to product availability)
* For purchases on properties up to £1m (or £2m in London and South East), AVMs can be used on any LTV (subject to product availability)

AVMs assist with instant mortgage decisions. Whether you apply through MAX or via other online systems (e.g. MTE or Trigold), the use of AVMs will help speed up the decision and offer a better process for your customer.

AVMs are only suitable for further borrowing where the latest valuation was a physical one (not an AVM).

In all further borrowing cases where the latest valuation was an AVM, a **Non-Disclosed PRA valuation** must be requested.

---

**Japanese Knotweed**

Japanese Knotweed is an invasive plant introduced into the UK and has no natural predators. The plant is known to exploit existing weaknesses in buildings. Applications where Japanese Knotweed is identified should be looked at in accordance with the following requirements:

**CATEGORY 4**
Japanese Knotweed is within 7 metres of the main building, habitable spaces, conservatory and/or garage and any permanent outbuilding (either within the curtilage of the property or on neighbouring land);
and/or

* To be reported in the valuation report together with a valuation of the property.
* Further investigation is required by a Property Care Association (PCA) registered or similarly qualified firm.
* All recommended remedial works must be covered by an insurance-backed guarantee (minimum 10 years, property-specific, transferable).
* An insurance-backed treatment plan must be confirmed prior to completion.
* It is not necessary for the remedial works to be completed before release of mortgage funds.

**CATEGORY 3**
Japanese Knotweed is present within the curtilage but more than 7 metres from the main building, habitable spaces, conservatory and/or garage.

* Report this in the valuation together with a valuation of the property.
* No further investigation or action is required.

If there is **minor damage** to outbuildings, structures, paths, or boundary walls/fences:

* Further investigation required by a PCA registered firm.
* All remedial works must be covered by an insurance-backed guarantee (minimum 10 years).
* An insurance-backed treatment plan must be confirmed prior to completion.
* Works need not be completed prior to mortgage fund release.

**CATEGORY 2**
Japanese Knotweed is not seen within the boundaries of the property, but is seen on a neighbouring property or land and is:

* Within 7 metres of the curtilage of the subject property, but
* More than 7 metres from the main building or any permanent outbuilding.

Report this in the valuation together with a valuation of the property. No further investigation or action required.

**CATEGORY 1**
Japanese Knotweed is not seen at the property, but can be seen on neighbouring land more than 7 metres away from the curtilage of the subject property.

Report this in the valuation together with a valuation of the property. No further investigation or action required.
