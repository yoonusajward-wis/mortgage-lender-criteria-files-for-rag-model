**Overview:**
A joint borrower sole proprietor mortgage (JBSP) allows additional people (non-owning joint borrowers) to be added to a mortgage while only the owner-occupier(s) (proprietors) are named on the deeds and therefore on the proprietorship register.

The non-owning joint borrower will be 'jointly and severally' responsible for the mortgage payments and for obliging by the terms and conditions of the mortgage. The Society's obligations in terms of responsible lending are the same as for all parties to the mortgage.

**Acceptable Reasons for JBSP:**
* The application must be for the owner occupiers main residential home and they must reside in the mortgaged property
* It enables the owner-occupier (proprietor(s)) to maximise their mortgage borrowing capability by combining incomes a non-owning joint borrower but retaining sole ownership of their property
* May be used in cases where the proprietor(s) independent income derived from employment, self-employment &/or pension sources is not enough to support the required level of borrowing without assistance

**Acceptable Supporting Joint Borrowers – Non-Occupying Parties:**

* **Acceptable relationships include:**
  * Son(s) or Daughter(s)

**For all applications Independent Legal Advice will be required**

**Affordability:**

**a) Owner-occupier:**
* The owner-occupier must have independent employed, self-employed and/or pension income and must be able to cover a minimum of 25% of the loan amount based on income multiples

* The overall income and expenditure assessment can include the income from all borrowers (max. 4)

**b) Non-owning joint borrowers:**
* The non-owning joint borrower will need to demonstrate a reliable level of income from an acceptable and verifiable source sufficient to meet the value of the shortfall in the owner-occupier's income, having first taken into account their own financial commitments
