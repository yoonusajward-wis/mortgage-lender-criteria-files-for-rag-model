## Income / Affordability

### Interest Cover Ratio (ICR) Requirements

**For single self-contained properties:**
* Basic rate taxpayers: 125% of stressed mortgage payment
* Higher rate taxpayers: 145% of stressed mortgage payment
* Additional rate taxpayers: 165% of stressed mortgage payment

**For HMOs, converted MUFBs, and mixed-use properties:**
* Basic rate taxpayers: 130% (or 145% in some cases)
* Higher rate taxpayers: 145%
* Additional rate taxpayers: 145%

**For company borrowers:**
* 120% for company borrowers
* 125% for individual borrowers

All ICRs are calculated at pay rate.

### Stress Rate Calculation

The stressed mortgage payment is calculated at the higher of:
* Pay rate plus 2%, or
* 5.5%

**For 5-year fixed rate products:**
* The stress rate used is the pay rate plus 1%, or 5%

**Reversionary rate:**
* The product rate plus Bank Base Rate, with a minimum BBR floor of 0%

### Rental Assessment

Rental income is assessed based on the valuer's estimated market rent, not the current rent.

We must be satisfied that the applicant(s) can withstand increases in mortgage interest rates, cover rental voids, and afford the mortgage both now and after any fixed or discounted period expires. We may request evidence of contingency funds to support increased mortgage payments and may decline an application if we believe the applicant will not be able to meet mortgage payments should interest rates increase.

### Outside Portfolio Checks

Octopus does not need to conduct affordability checks on portfolios it does not finance. However, an asset and liability (A&L) statement is required with every application to assess the applicant's financial position.

---

## Capital Raising

Capital raising is permitted for the following purposes:

* Purchasing additional investment properties
* Deleveraging other investment properties
* Carrying out maintenance works on properties within the applicant's portfolio

**Important:** If more than 40% of the funds raised are for personal use, Octopus will treat the application as a regulated buy-to-let and decline it. This list is not exhaustive.
