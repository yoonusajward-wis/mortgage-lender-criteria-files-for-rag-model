**Sale of Another Property:**
- Valuation within previous 6 months; proof of ownership; and most recent annual mortgage statement (if mortgaged).
- Maximum 80% of current value (i.e. repayment strategy will remain sufficient if property value falls by 20%), less any lending on the property.

## SECTION 10 – DEBT CONSOLIDATION

### Standard Debt Consolidation

- Defined as when more than 50% of the funds being raised are to repay existing credit commitments.
- Maximum LTV: 80%.

- Evidence required:
  - 2 months' bank statements evidencing that the customer can afford current outgoings, or that the saving will be sufficient to allow the customer to meet all expenditure.

---

## SECTION 11 – CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS

- Borrowers with a criminal conviction which is spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 are within criteria.
- A minor traffic offence (e.g. fixed penalty notice) is not considered a criminal conviction and is therefore within criteria.
- No Lend where an applicant has an unspent criminal conviction.

---

## SECTION 12 – FOREIGN CURRENCY LOANS

A Foreign Currency Loan is defined as a Pounds Sterling loan provided to either:

- A customer who has income received in a currency other than Pounds Sterling, or
- A customer whose repayment strategy for an interest-only loan is in a currency other than Pounds Sterling.

Non-sterling loans are outside policy.

### Customer Income in a Foreign Currency

- Normal income evidence applies.
- If all or part of the foreign income is required to demonstrate affordability, affordability for the foreign currency part is assessed by applying a 20% depreciation to that income (to reduce the effect of a 20% reduction in the exchange rate).
- Exchange Rate Risk: Underwriters may impose a condition requiring a charge over a deposit account containing 6 months' mortgage payments (at product rate) to cover any shortfall arising from exchange rate fluctuations.

### Repayment Strategy Involving a Foreign Asset

- Non-sterling stocks and shares: the asset's suitability is assessed and depreciated by 20%; the sterling equivalent is then considered as the appropriate level for the repayment strategy on that part of the loan.
- Property owned abroad is not accepted as a suitable repayment strategy.
