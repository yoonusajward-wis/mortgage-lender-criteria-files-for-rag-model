## Important Factors for Application Review

Your mortgage loan will be reviewed based on a series of factors that will determine the response to your application. While this calculation is quite complex, the following points will be considered. Knowing these may help you to plan and prepare for your application in advance and will also help you if a mortgage loan is something you wish to consider in the future instead of the present.
### Affordability
As a responsible lender, Step One will want to ensure you have the means to make your monthly repayments for your chosen loan term. We will carry out a full review of your income and outgoings to determine that the mortgage loan is affordable for you both now and in the foreseeable future.
### Employment History
Taking a mortgage loan is a serious financial obligation. This means that as lenders we review your employment history to provide a sense of your ability to repay your loan consistently. Where employment is concerned, this means that we will review your history to see if there are large gaps in your previous employment.
The length of your time employed with individual companies will also be factored into your application. As a rule, longer stays in one position are ideal as opposed to regular movement between jobs that may indicate unreliability in making repayments on your mortgage loan.
### Credit History
Your credit history is one of the most important factors in your application and will be reviewed closely. When reviewing your application for a Step One mortgage loan, your credit history will be analysed to discern trends of repayments and debt.
As a loan of this kind is a significant obligation, your credit history is important in demonstrating your previous consistency in making repayments and managing debt.
### Equity
A primary consideration in your mortgage loan application is equity. This is the difference between the amount still owed in the mortgage and your home's fair market value. Equity is determined by subtracting the balance remaining on your primary mortgage from the current market value of your home. A percentage of this amount would be the equity used to secure the amount you wish to borrow on your mortgage loan.

While your application will be approved or declined based on a combination of factors, a greater amount of equity will typically result in the best possible rates for your personal circumstances.

## Application Review Process

Applications are reviewed based on multiple factors including:
- Affordability assessment
- Employment history
- Credit history
- Available equity
- Income verification
- Outgoing commitments
All loans are subject to status. The rate you are offered will depend on your personal circumstances, past credit conduct and other related factors.

## Important Warnings and Disclaimers

### APR

Please note that Step One Finance does not charge up-front fees for any loan enquiries or applications. You should be wary of any parties purporting to arrange a Step One Finance loan who are seeking to charge up-front fees. Please contact us if you have any doubts regarding a Step One Finance loan application. Customers can also obtain additional information on the FCA's website on the dangers of Loan Fee Fraud by clicking here.
### Repossession Warning
**THINK CAREFULLY BEFORE SECURING OTHER DEBTS AGAINST YOUR HOME. YOUR HOME MAY BE REPOSSESSED IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP REPAYMENTS ON A MORTGAGE OR ANY OTHER DEBT SECURED ON IT.**
### Debt Consolidation Warning
**IF YOU ARE THINKING OF CONSOLIDATING EXISTING BORROWING YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IF YOU ARE EXTENDING THE TERM OF THE DEBT YOU MAY BE INCREASING THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU NEED TO REPAY.**
