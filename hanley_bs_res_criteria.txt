5.8 AFFORDABILITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The amount we will lend is based upon an applicant's income and expenditure. The Society uses ONS data to determine some areas of spending and this is based on household composition and the geographical area of the property.

We will also review your Credit Report and Bank Statements to ensure all expenditure has been included. Adjustments will be made where necessary e.g. If additional expenditure is noted such as gambling transactions.

A stressed mortgage rate is applied in calculating affordability other than where the mortgage rate is fixed for 5 years or more.

Whilst affordability is the overriding factor when assessing a mortgage, income multiples are used as a guide. The maximum is 5 x joint income.

For all Buy to Let applications where the rental income (confirmed by the valuer) does not meet the rental criteria interest coverage ratio (ICR) a full affordability assessment is required. BTL – Applications based on affordability.

There are specific requirements for RIO applicants RIO - Affordability

10.1 STANDARD BUY TO LET & CONSUMER BUY TO LET
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are not acceptable for BTL applications:
- More than 2 applicants.
- Portfolio landlords.
- Guarantors.
- Where the mortgage introducer is also the applicant.
- Where the applicant is related to the vendor.
- Tenanted by family/close relatives.

10.2 AFFORDABILITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Standard Buy to Let**

Affordability is assessed using the anticipated rental income from the property, as confirmed by the valuer, and applying an interest coverage ratio (ICR) of 145% using our current stressed mortgage rate.

Example: - £100,000 x 7.17% x 145% = £9657/12 = £804.75 (the rental income confirmed by the valuer must be equal to or more than this figure to meet ICR criteria.

The ICR calculation considers any potential rental voids, maintenance and repair costs associated with property. Where the ICR is not met, we will consider "top slicing" and a full affordability check will be undertaken. The case will "refer" in the system to allow this check to be undertaken.

Personal income will be assessed in addition to the above to ensure that the applicant meets the minimum income requirements.

--- Page 36 ---

Lending Policy Appendix 1: Lending Criteria V2.1

**Consumer Buy to Let**

Affordability is assessed using the applicant's net income, rental income from the property being mortgaged, a stressed mortgage payment and using the ICR calculation to ensure rental voids, maintenance and repair costs are considered.

Personal income will be assessed in addition to the above to ensure that the applicant meets the minimum income requirements and can afford their current financial commitments and expenditure.

10.3 EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Applicants must be employed/self-employed or in receipt of pension income and the source of income must be from within the UK except for Ex-Pat BTL.

Income from housing allowances, rent allowances and state benefits are not considered.

10.4 TOP SLICING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Top slicing enables customers who don't meet the ICR criteria to use a proportion of their earned income to support the lending.

**Note:** Top slicing is not permitted on Ex-Pat BTL. If the application fails the ICR criteria a reduced loan amount may be offered.

Cases failing the ICR criteria described in 10.2 will automatically refer to an underwriter prior to full application. A full affordability assessment will be carried out as part of an application/DIP to ensure that the applicants have enough disposable income to cover any rental shortfall on this and any other buy to let properties together with existing financial commitments e.g. residential mortgage, loan, credit cards.

The following details our requirements when using top slicing:

18 VALUATIONS
================================================================================

The Society will arrange a valuation for all house purchase and remortgage applications. In certain cases, a "desktop" valuation may be utilised. This approach does not require a physical inspection of the property; instead, the valuer relies on sales data and digital tools to determine the property's value.

The use of desktop valuations is at the Society's discretion, and there may be circumstances where this method is not appropriate. If, after instruction, the valuer deems a desktop valuation unsuitable, they will recommend a physical inspection of the property.

For remortgage applications, where the property has recently undergone substantial alterations/home improvements you should include a note on the application so that a physical valuation can be obtained.

DESKTOP VALUATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Society will typically use a desktop valuation in the following scenarios:

- Application type: Remortgage applications
- Loan-to-Value (LTV): Up to 70%
- Property value: Not exceeding £750,000

**Exclusions (Out of Scope):** Desktop valuations are not suitable for the following property types:

- Flats or maisonettes
- New builds or properties constructed in the last 24 months
- Self-build properties
- Shared ownership properties
- Listed buildings
- Converted properties, including barn conversions
- Properties with land exceeding 1 acre

- Ex-local authority properties
- Properties requiring modernization or refurbishment
- Properties with no online visibility on Rightmove
