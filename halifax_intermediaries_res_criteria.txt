## Additional Affordability Considerations

**EPC rating:** Used in affordability (energy costs). A/B may increase max loan slightly; F/G may decrease; C/D/E or unknown – no change.

**Condition:** We may deduct financial planning commitments, contractor adjustments, or credit commitments as ongoing (even if customer intends to repay); if max loan reduces, loan amount must be reduced. Interest only: monthly premiums for repayment vehicle (endowment/ISA) included; specify at DIP and full application. Affordability includes future income/expenditure changes.

**Option:** If max loan below request: extend term (to retirement) or into retirement (with retirement income evidence).

**Requirement:** If max loan reduced because income not evidenced at declared level, loan amount must be reduced.

**Exception (loan above model):** Only (1) Existing Halifax customers with no increase in loan or LTV (see Existing Customers), or (2) Additional income for life of mortgage, evidenced per our requirements.

**Note:** [Mortgage Prisoners](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria.html#mortgage_prisoner) – see dedicated section.
