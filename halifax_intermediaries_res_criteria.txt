### First Monthly Payment & Initial Interest

**Overview:**
The first monthly payment collection date and calculation method differs from subsequent payments due to initial interest charges.

**Collection Date:**

**General Rule:**
- The first monthly payment is always collected in the month following completion
- Example: If a mortgage completes in June, the first payment will be collected in July
- Collected on the customer's chosen monthly payment date

**Exception:**
- If completion occurs in the last few days of any month AND results in less than 4 working days between the completion date and the customer's chosen payment date (excluding those days)
- Then the first payment will be collected on the 10th of that month
- This date will then revert to the customer's chosen payment date on the following month

**Initial Interest Calculation:**

**What is Included:**
The first monthly payment includes:
- An amount of 'Initial Interest' from the day of completion to the end of that month, PLUS
- The first monthly mortgage payment

**Examples:**
- **If completion occurs on the 15th:** Interest is calculated from the 15th to the end of the month and then added to the first payment
- **If completion occurs on the 5th:** Interest is calculated from the 5th to the end of the month and then added to the first payment

**Mortgage Illustration:**
- The 'Amount of each instalment' section of the mortgage illustration sets out a first payment assuming a mortgage completes on the 1st of the following month
- A customer's first monthly payment may be different as it will depend on when the loan starts
- We write to all customers when the mortgage starts to tell them when we will collect their first and subsequent payments
### Interest Only

Interest Only mortgages require customers to have a repayment plan in place to repay the capital at the end of the mortgage term. Halifax offers various repayment vehicle options, each with specific eligibility criteria and evidence requirements.

**Maximum LTV Limits:**

**Standard Interest Only:**
- **Maximum 75% LTV** for full interest only mortgages

**Sale of Mortgaged Property (SOMP) - Main Residence:**

- Customers can borrow up to **85% LTV** with the balance on capital and interest repayment

**Important Points on the Assessment:**

**Disclaimer:**
- We are not providing advice on your customer's repayment plan(s)
- We are not making any guarantee that their plan(s) will be sufficient to repay the outstanding balance (capital) at the end of the mortgage term

**Customer Responsibilities:**
- Your customer should review their plan(s) regularly during the term of their mortgage to make sure it is on track to repay the outstanding balance
- It is your customer's responsibility to ensure they have sufficient funds to repay their outstanding balance at the end of the mortgage term
- If they are unable to do so, their home may be repossessed to repay the outstanding balance

**Ongoing Monitoring:**
- Periodically, we will ask your customer to provide evidence of their repayment plan(s)
- If your customer is unable to satisfy us that their repayment plan(s) remains on track to repay the outstanding balance on their mortgage, we may ask your customer to transfer some or all of their mortgage onto a capital and interest repayment basis
**Important Points on Repayment Plans:**

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- Repayment plans CANNOT be accepted if they include the name of anyone NOT named on the mortgage
- Only repayment vehicles for those customers intending to live at the mortgaged property may be used to support the loan
- Example: If a parent is named on the mortgage to help with affordability, then a property in the parent's name cannot be accepted as a repayment vehicle

**Multiple Repayment Plans:**
- Your customer can use more than one repayment plan to cover their total interest only amount
- In this case, please send the relevant evidence for all repayment plans

**NOT Acceptable Repayment Plans:**
The following are NOT acceptable repayment plans:
- Sale of other commercial property
- Sale of non property assets
- Inheritance

**Additional Requirements:**
- Maturity dates will be requested for each applicable repayment plan
- The mortgage term must finish before a maximum age of 70 years (rather than 80 years for repayment mortgages)
- For pension and bonus repayment plan types: the maximum term would be restricted further if there was a lower anticipated retirement age

**Existing Halifax Mortgage Customers Moving Home:**
- If an existing customer does not meet the current interest only rules, we may consider allowing interest only on the new mortgage up to the level held currently
- This is provided the mortgage term is not increasing
- Please refer to your BDM for guidance
### Lending Into Retirement

## Income, Employment and Affordability

**Overview:**
This section covers how Halifax assesses income, employment status, and affordability to determine the maximum loan amount available to customers.

### Affordability, LTI and Income Multiples

**Overview:**
Halifax uses affordability as a way of assessing how much they will lend. Where the loan requested is above the maximum loan available from our affordability calculation, the loan amount should be reduced to proceed or the application will be declined.

**Affordability Calculator:**
- Please refer to our [affordability calculator](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/tools-calculators/mortgage-affordability-calculator.html)

**Important Note:**
- The affordability calculator will give a guide to the amount we would be willing to lend
- However, as no credit search is carried out, please be aware that this amount is subject to change once the Decision in Principle (DIP) is keyed

**Loan to Income (LTI) Caps:** 
When calculating affordability, the following Loan to Income (LTI) caps also apply. These can be used to calculate the maximum loan that would be available based on income but these are caps and the actual maximum loan could be lower and can be impacted by loan to value and credit score.
| Income | LTV | Loans ≤£750K | Loans >£750K |  
---|---|---|---  
| <£40K | 0 - 95% | 4.49x | N/A |  
| £40K - <£50K | 0 - 85% | 4.75x | N/A |
| £40K - <£50K | 85.01 - 95% | 4.49x | N/A |  
| £50K - £75K | 0 - 75% | 5.00x | N/A |
| £50K - £75K | 75.01 - 85% | 5.00x | N/A |
| £50K - £75K | 85.01 - 95% | 4.49x | N/A |  
| >£75K - £125K | 0 - 75% | 5.50x | 5.50x |
| >£75K - £125K | 75.01 - 85% | 5.00x | 5.00x |
| >£75K - £125K | 85.01 - 90% | 4.75x (loan ≤£500K)<br>4.49x (loan >£500K - ≤£750K) | N/A |
| >£75K - £125K | 90.01 - 95% | 4.49x | N/A |  
| >£125K | 0 - 85% | 5.50x | 5.50x |
| >£125K | 85.01 - 90% | 4.75x (loan ≤£500K)<br>4.49x (loan >£500K - ≤£750K) | N/A |
| >£125K | 90.01 - 95% | 4.49x | N/A |  
### First Time Buyer Boost

**Overview:**
First Time Buyer Boost offers enhanced LTI caps for eligible first-time buyers, allowing higher borrowing relative to income.

**First Time Buyer Boost LTI Table:**
Income |  LTV |  LTI  
---|---|---  
Income £50K+ |  LTV 0 - 90% |  LTI 5.50x  
Income £50K+ |  LTV 90.01 - 95% |  LTI 4.49x  
**Eligibility Criteria:**

To qualify for First Time Buyer Boost LTI, ALL of the following must apply:

- **Purchase applications only**
- **Any applicant is a first-time buyer** (could be one applicant on a joint application, key FTB as first applicant)
- **Total income on application is £50,000 or more**
- **Loan to value (LTV) is 90% or less**
- **Not available on shared equity or shared ownership schemes**
- **For applications with any element of self-employed income:** please refer to the standard LTI table

**Credit Profile Restrictions:**
- For a small number of applications, the overall credit profile may restrict the LTI applied to 5.00x rather than 5.50x shown
- The level of credit score may mean standard LTIs will apply

**Important Notes:**
**Affordable Housing Schemes:**
- If the loan is for an Affordable Housing scheme (Shared Equity or Shared Ownership), then a scheme max LTI of 4.49x would apply

**Self-Employed Income:**
- If there is any element of self-employed income on an application and the application income is up to £75k: a maximum LTI of 4.49x will apply
- For loans where the application income >£75k, and there is any element of self-employed income:
  - The normal 5.50x maximum LTI applies up to 75% LTV
  - For loans >£500,000 to £750,000 of 85.01% to 95% LTV: a 4.00x LTI will apply
  - For loans >£750,000 to £1m of 75.01% to 85% LTV: a 4.00x LTI will apply

**Remortgage Customers:**
- For like for like remortgage customers with no additional borrowing, who receive employed income only, up to 75% loan to value (LTV) and subject to credit score: a 5.50x LTI will apply where the standard LTI would normally be below this level
- A maximum LTI of 4.49x will still apply for remortgages on an Affordable Housing scheme (Shared Equity or Shared Ownership)

**Credit Score Restrictions:**
- The level of credit score achieved and overall credit profile may restrict the LTI applied
- This may be restricted to:
  - 4.49x, OR
  - 5.00x rather than 5.50x shown, OR
  - If income >£75k and loan >£500k where 4.49x shows, this may be restricted to 4.00x

**Product-Specific LTI:**
- A different maximum LTI may sometimes apply as a result of the particular product selected
**Additional Affordability Considerations:**

**Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) Rating:**
- A property's Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating is used in our affordability calculations
- This allows us to reflect a more tailored view of energy costs
- A customer whose property has a higher EPC rating (e.g. A/B) will generally have lower energy costs than those with a lower EPC rating (F/G) on like-for-like use
- **For properties with an A/B EPC rating:** you may see a small increase in the maximum loan amount available
- **For properties with an F/G EPC rating:** a small decrease
- **For properties with a C, D or E EPC rating or where the EPC is unknown:** there is no change to the maximum loan available

**Financial Planning Commitments:**
- For some customers, we may make a deduction within our affordability calculation to allow for financial planning commitments the customer may have going forward

**Contractor Affordability Adjustments:**
- Within our affordability calculation, we may apply an affordability adjustment for some contractors to take into account likely business expenses

**Credit Commitments:**
- In some circumstances, we may deduct credit commitments as ongoing in our affordability calculation even when customers have declared an intention to repay these
- If the maximum loan available is reduced as a result, then the loan amount must be reduced to proceed

**Interest Only Loans:**
- When calculating affordability on interest only loans, Halifax will take into account the monthly premiums payable for the relevant repayment vehicle (i.e. existing endowment or new or existing ISA)
- Please ensure the premium(s) is specified at both DIP and full application

**Future Changes:**
- Affordability must also include future changes to income and expenditure

**Extending Mortgage Term:**
- Where the maximum loan available is below that requested, there may be the option to:
  - Extend the term (up to retirement), OR
  - Extend term into retirement (subject to evidence of adequate retirement income)

**Income Evidence:**
- Please note: if the maximum loan available is reduced due to income not being evidenced at the declared level, then the loan amount must be reduced accordingly

**Exceptions - Loan Amount Above Affordability Model:**

Only in the below scenarios may we consider a loan amount above the maximum loan from our affordability model:

1. **Existing Halifax mortgage customers** with no increase in loan amount or loan to value (LTV) compared with their current mortgage (see Existing Customers section)
2. **Additional income** not previously considered, that is expected for the life of the mortgage and can be evidenced in line with our requirements

**Mortgage Prisoners:**
- For Mortgage Prisoners criteria, please refer to our [Mortgage Prisoners section](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria.html#mortgage_prisoner)
### Commitments and Outgoings

**Overview:**
All customer commitments and outgoings must be accurately declared and keyed to ensure a proper affordability assessment. This section outlines what needs to be included and how different commitment types are treated.

#### Important Reminders

##### Accuracy of Keying

**General Requirements:**
- It is very important that all commitments are keyed accurately so we can make an accurate affordability assessment
- Please ensure you are familiar with the full list of commitment types that need to be keyed and how different commitments are treated, as shown in the table below
- You should have a thorough conversation with the customer around all their commitments/outgoings
- It is recommended that you ask the customer to provide a copy of their credit report from the credit reference agencies to ensure all commitments are included
- Only if there are no commitments should 'None' be selected from the system dropdown list
- Please include any additional commitments that have been applied as a credit entry with credit reference agencies/bureaus (e.g. mobile phone contracts)

##### Commitments to be Repaid on or Before Completion

**Keying Requirements:**
- Commitments to be repaid on or before completion must still be keyed
- You should select 'Yes' for 'Intend to Repay on Completion'
- This includes the existing mortgage on a remortgage application

**When to Mark as 'To be Repaid':**
Commitments should only be marked as to be repaid where ALL of the following apply:
- The customer advises it is their definite intention to repay these by completion
- This appears plausible given the amount of the payments required and remaining term of the commitment
- You are satisfied they have adequate means to repay these commitments (e.g. from available savings or regular income)

**Special Conditions:**
- Where commitments are keyed as to be repaid, a special condition on the mortgage offer will state the mortgage has been assessed on the basis of the declared intention to repay these commitments
- It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that these commitments are repaid
- Completion takes place on the condition that such repayment takes place

**Recently Repaid Commitments:**
- If any commitments were recently repaid but may still be shown on credit reference agencies/bureau information, these commitments should be keyed and marked as 'Yes' for 'Intend to Repay on Completion'

**Partial Repayment:**
- If repaying part of an outstanding commitment, then it must be split and keyed as two commitments:
  - One to be repaid
  - One to remain

**High LTV Applications:**
- For all loans above 85% loan to value (LTV) – and for any other applications where we decide that it is prudent – we will deduct commitments as ongoing even where the customer has declared an intention to repay these at or before completion
- The loan amount must be affordable with these commitments deducted as remaining

##### Payslips

**Important Checks:**
- Please check if a customer's payslips show any deductions that should be keyed as commitments, such as:
  - Student loans
  - Child care vouchers
  - Salary sacrifice loan schemes (e.g. cars)

##### Keying Hints

**General Guidelines:**
- Where keying commitments with no definitive 'End Date': key a likely end date
- For commitments with a monthly payment and no total outstanding balance: key the balance as an annual commitment (i.e. 12 x monthly payment)

**Related Sections:**
- **Financial dependants:** Please see our [Dependants](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria.html#dependants) section for the definition of child and adult dependants
- **Adverse credit history:** Please see [Adverse Credit](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria.html#adverse_credit) for guidance on how to answer these application questions

##### Property
Property Commitment type |  Notes  
---|---  
Commitment type **Mortgage** |  Notes
    * On Remortgages the existing mortgage to be replaced with our mortgage must be keyed as a commitment with ‘Yes’ for ‘Intend to Repay’; under source of funds select other and type ‘this mortgage’
    * A mortgage ‘type’ must be completed for any mortgage commitment which will usually be either ‘Residential’, or ‘Buy to Let’ if the property is already let or is to be let
    * For any Buy to Let (BTL) mortgages please also key the rental income received under ‘Other income’ in the customer’s income section. If the gross rental income received is below 125% of the BTL mortgage payments the shortfall will automatically be deducted as a commitment in our affordability assessment
    * If an existing residential mortgage is being remortgaged/converted to a BTL then key a residential mortgage as being repaid and a new BTL mortgage commitment as to remain with the new balance/payment that will apply upon completion
    * For any other ‘residential’ mortgaged properties to remain in the background an assumed running cost will be deducted within the affordability assessment  
Commitment type **Ground rent** |  Notes
    * If purchasing a leasehold property you must tick ‘Yes’ to ‘Do you intend to purchase a flat?’
    * Under Commitment type you will then be able to key the service charge and/or ground rent amounts
    * Key £1 if no fee applies
    * At Decision in Principle stage if the commitments have not been keyed, as not known, we will use an assumed value for these in our affordability calculation, which may mean that at Full Application when the true details are keyed under the property details page, this could affect the loan amount we are willing to lend
    * When a full application is keyed and the service charge/ground rent keyed under the property details, we will use the higher of the value from the commitments screen or property details screen, so there is no need to amend/delete the details keyed under the credit commitments as they will not be counted twice  
Commitment type **Service charge** |  Notes
    * (See under Ground rent)  
Commitment type **Second home** |  Notes
    * Should be selected if an unencumbered residential property will remain in the background
    * Key £1 as running cost and a standard deduction for these costs will be included in our affordability calculation

##### Other
Other Commitment type |  Notes  
---|---  
Commitment type **Other regular committed expenditure** |  Notes
    * For any other regular committed expenditure which the customer could not, or would not want to stop, and it doesn’t fit into any category
    * Anything keyed as ‘other’ will be deducted in our affordability calculation, even if it is selected as being repaid on completion  
For Shared Ownership/Shared Equity schemes the rental/interest payments are collected within the ‘Scheme’ details screen and should not be keyed as Commitments.
We will use assumed values for the following within our affordability assessment which means the following **do not** need to be keyed as commitments:
    * Council Tax
    * Utility bills e.g. water or energy
    * TV Licence
    * Insurance
    * Travel costs
    * Motor maintenance and repair
    * Internet and multimedia
    * Clothing
    * Household shopping e.g. food
If a customer does advise they are paying more for any of these commitments than an average customer would, then you should key these in as a commitment under ‘other’.
### Contractors

**Overview:**
Where a customer's income comes from a contract and they are not employed on a permanent basis, they are classed as a contractor. This will include individuals who are self-employed and pay their own tax, those who are employed via an umbrella company who deduct their tax, and people who are essentially employed but on a fixed/short term contract (e.g. 12 months).

**Classification:**
Contractors can be treated as self-employed or employed for income verification purposes:

#### Self Employed

**Treat as Self Employed if ANY of the following apply:**
- The customer pays their own tax, OR
- Has more than 1 contract, OR
- Has set up a limited company and employs other contractors

**Income Verification:**
- Income is confirmed as standard for self-employed customers

#### Employed

**Treat as Employed if:**
- Tax is paid by the company they work for (or they are employed via an umbrella company who deduct tax), OR
- Contractors who earn more than £500 per day or £75k per annum, OR are an IT contractor on any income, can be treated as employed irrespective if the customer pays their own tax, or classes themselves as self-employed
  - **Exception:** Where a customer has more than one contract or they have set up a limited company and employs other contractors, in which case they should be treated as self-employed

**Additional Requirements to be Treated as Employed:**
Additionally, to be treated as employed, the customer must have EITHER:
- **12 months or more continuous employment**, with 6 months of the contract remaining, OR
- **2 years continuous service** (for the last 2 years as at the date of application) in the same type of employment
When we are treating a contractor as employed for income verification these are our requirements:
**Contractor Who Pays Own Tax, or It Is Deducted by Umbrella Company (Including IR35):**

**Required Documentation:**
- Copy of latest contract and latest month's payslip(s) required (or where payslips not issued: latest month's bank statement)

**Income Calculation:**
- Income to be used is the **lower of**:
  - The gross value of the contract, OR
  - Income calculated from payslip(s)/bank statement

**Gross Value of Contract Calculation:**
- **Daily rate:** Daily rate on the contract × 5 days per week × 46 weeks per year
- **Hourly rate:** Hourly rate × 7 hours per day × 5 days per week × 46 weeks per year
- **Exception:** If the contract states the actual hours/days worked are lower, use these figures

**Income from Payslip(s)/Bank Statement Calculation:**
- Multiply the gross pay received to give an annual figure
- Calculate the income based on a **46 week year** (unless the contract states the actual weeks to be worked is lower)
- **Example:** Multiply gross pay on a monthly payslip × 12, divide by 52 weeks and multiply by 46
- **Alternative:** Average the gross pay on the weekly payslips and × 46

**Umbrella Payslips:**
- The total gross pay showing on umbrella payslips may be broken down by basic salary, commission, 'additional taxable income', holiday pay etc.
- As long as the contract confirms the contractor is paid via a daily rate or hourly rate, the income does not need to be split into these separate elements and can all be keyed as basic salary

**Limited Company/LLP Considerations:**
- For customers who have set up a Limited Company or a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP): the income evidence must be from the actual contracted employer, not their own Limited Company
- **Multiple Shareholders:**
  - If there are other shareholders, and they are also to be named on the mortgage: the income from the contract must be keyed for one customer only and no income from this contract can be keyed for the other applicants that are shareholders
  - If there are other shareholders, but they are not to be named on the mortgage: the income should be keyed to reflect the customer share (e.g. if 50% share then 50% of income should be used)
**Fixed/Short Term or Agency; Tax Is Deducted by Employer (Not Including IR35):**

**Required Documentation:**
- The latest month's payslip(s) must be used to evidence income, OR
- Latest 3 months' payslips where other income is being used

**Income Calculation:**
- Income from payslip is calculated by multiplying the gross pay received to give an annual figure
- Then calculate the income based on a **46 week year**
- **Example:** Multiply gross pay on a monthly payslip × 12, divide by 52 weeks and multiply by 46
- **Alternative:** Average the gross pay on the weekly payslips and × 46
**Construction Industry Scheme Contractors (CIS):**

**Overview:**
Applications from customers employed on a Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) Contract will be considered.

**Required Documentation:**
- Latest 3 months consecutive payslips/invoices/statement along with corresponding bank statements
- This could be from the same or different contracts

**Income Calculation:**
- **Example:** If income in January, February and March is used, payslips/invoices/statement and corresponding bank statements must be for January, February and March
- An average of the latest 3 months income should be used
- This average amount should then be calculated based on a **46 week year**
- **Calculation:** Multiply the average monthly pay × 12, divide by 52 weeks and multiply by 46

**Zero Income:**
- If no income is received or the customer is unable to provide both pieces of evidence of income, then 'zero' income must be used for that month

**Self-Employed Treatment:**
- Customers should be treated as self-employed if they pay their own tax or sub contract to more than one company
**Zero Hours Contracts:**

**Overview:**
Applications from customers employed on a zero hours contract for over 12 months will be considered.

**Required Documentation:**
- Proof of all income in the last 12 months is required
- That total income figure will be used
**Probation:**

**Overview:**
Income from probationary employment is only used where the probationary period is part of a permanent contract. If the contract is purely probationary with the employer having the option to terminate the contract, then this income cannot be used.

**Keying Requirements:**

**Permanent Employment with Probationary Period:**
- Where the applicant receives an offer of permanent employment and the contract states an initial probationary period (e.g. three or six months): it should be keyed as 'permanent'
- The income will be used in the affordability assessment

**Probationary Contract:**
- Where the applicant is offered a probationary contract (e.g. for three months), at the end of which the employer has the option to determine if a permanent contract will be offered: it should be keyed as 'probationary'
- The income will NOT be used in the affordability assessment
**Professional Sports People:**

**Overview:**
Applications will be considered from Professional Sports People where either:
- Continuous employment of 12 months or more with 6 months of the contract remaining, OR
- 2 years continuous service (for the last two years as at the date of application) in the same type of employment can be confirmed

**Important Consideration:**
It is essential to establish that such individuals will have the ability to sustainably meet the monthly repayments as they near the end of their career or if their career should be ended abruptly due to injury.
### Non-Sterling Income (Foreign Income)

**Overview:**
Non-sterling income can be accepted on purchase, remortgage, further advance (FA) and product transfer (PT) applications where a full affordability assessment is required. There is no minimum income level for non-sterling income to be used. For FAs/PTs, non-sterling income can be used even if this was not included on the original purchase/remortgage application.

**Accepted Currencies:**
We will accept income in the following five non-sterling currencies:
- US Dollar
- Euro
- Australian Dollar
- Indian Rupee
- Swiss Franc

**Accepted Income Types:**
- **Employed income:** Basic salary, bonus, overtime and commission
- **Self-employed income:** Only a partner of an LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) where the income can be keyed as self-employed and is verified to a letter from a finance director
- **Not accepted:** Non-Sterling income cannot be accepted for 'other income' types

**Currency Restrictions:**
- We can include sterling income and non-sterling income on the same application
- We can only use **one non-sterling currency** on an application

**Exchange Rates and Affordability Calculator:**
- Our website Mortgage affordability calculator will collect non-sterling incomes
- This calculation is based on current exchange rates, so when an application is made they may receive a different rate
- When a Decision in Principle (DIP) is keyed, the exchange rate to be used on that application will not then change, so the maximum loan available would not change due to any currency fluctuations

**Income Keying:**
- On our income screens you'll see a currency dropdown field
- Key in the amount in the originating non-sterling currency, **not** the equivalent GBP amount
- We'll convert the income amount to GBP and apply a haircut of:
  - **20%** for standard income
  - **10%** for bonus income
- This haircut covers any potential currency fluctuations
- **Note:** The amount of any 'haircuts' are subject to change

**Income Verification:**
- If payslips show the amount in the originating currency: that is sufficient
- If payslips only show the converted GBP figure: you should upload a compensation letter/remuneration statement in addition to the payslip(s)
- This document should show the income amount in the original currency, which is what we will require

**Compensation Letter/Remuneration Statement Requirements:**
The compensation letter/remuneration statement can be a document that was sent directly to the customer by their employer, or received online, but should show:
- Employer name
- Employee name (to match the application and payslip)
- Pay date
- Non-sterling currency using
- Income type (e.g. salary or bonus) clearly denoted

**Documentation Language:**
- Payslips and any other documents must be in English language

**UK Residency Requirements:**
- All mortgage applicants must be UK residents, which means they must have a 'primary address' in the UK
- If someone's primary address is outside the UK and they only have a correspondence address in the UK, they are not a UK resident
- A correspondence or family member's address must not be declared as a primary address
- A primary address does not need to be the address where someone spends the majority, or even a certain proportion, of their time (e.g. they could spend the majority of their time at a foreign address due to working abroad but still have their primary address in the UK)
- This is not the same as 'tax residency' and we do not require customers meet any tax resident requirements

**Definition of Non-Sterling Income:**
- Non-sterling income is any income other than sterling received by a customer
- Non-sterling income converted to GBP to be paid into a UK bank account is still considered to be non-sterling income
- **Exception:** Channel Islands/Crown Dependencies (i.e. Jersey, Guernsey and Isle of Man) plus Gibraltar and Falkland Islands should be treated as GBP and not non-sterling

**Mortgage Illustration:**
- When non-sterling income is used, two additional paragraphs will show on the Mortgage Illustration in the 'Main features of loan' and 'Amount of each instalment' sections
- A letter will be sent to the customer after completion if the exchange rate goes down by more than 20% to advise them and confirm the support available if required
**Frequently Asked Questions:**

**Q – Can you accept a contractor with a contract in a non-sterling currency?**
A – Yes, standard contractor income verification requirements would apply:
- A copy of the contract would be required together with bank statements or payslips to show the actual income being received
- If bank statements only show the converted GBP amount received, then to consider the application, payslips or a compensation letter/remuneration statement would need to be available to show the amount received in the non-sterling currency

**Q – What is the treatment for seafarer contractors?**
A – The seafarers employment type refers to people who may work in various different roles on a seagoing vessel (e.g. on a cruise ship or oil rig). Seafarers can be permanently employed but are most commonly contractors who are responsible for paying their own tax (which includes people who may say they are 'tax exempt').

**Seafarer Contractors – Non-Sterling Income:**
- **Do they receive the equivalent of more than £500 per day or £75,000 per annum?**
  - **Yes:** Follow our standard contractor policy
    - A copy of the contract would be required together with bank statements or payslips to show the actual income being received
    - If bank statements only show the converted GBP amount received, then to consider the application, payslips or a compensation letter/remuneration statement would need to be available to show the amount received in the non-sterling currency
  - **No:** The application cannot be considered
    - Below the income level required to follow contractor policy, they would need to be treated as self-employed, and we cannot consider self-employed income if non-sterling

**Seafarer Contractors – Sterling (GBP) Income:**
- Follow the standard treatment of contractor or self-employed given the customer's employment basis/income level

**Q – Can you accept a self-employed customer where the business receives some income from overseas?**
A – **If a company is not UK based:** We could not use self-employed income as we would be unable to evidence this income per our standard self-employed verification requirements

**If a company is UK based:** We will use sterling income as evidenced on tax calculations (SA302s) and tax year overviews as normal. If a 'Foreign income' amount is shown on the SA302, this amount should not be included in the income keyed.

**Q – How do I key a bonus received in different currencies in each of the last 2 years (e.g. previous year bonus in US$ and latest year in GBP)?**
A – Only the latest year's bonus could be used. The currency selected would be the currency of the latest year's bonus. A two year average would be calculated using the latest year's bonus amount and zero bonus for the previous year.

**Q – Do customers need to be paid into a UK bank account?**
A – No, there is no specific requirement that income is paid into a UK bank account. All applicants must be UK residents as normal.

**Q – Do payslips need to show UK tax being deducted?**
A – No, there is no requirement for payslips to show UK tax being deducted, and they could show no tax or foreign tax being deducted. All applicants must be UK residents as normal.

### Maximum Working Age

**Overview:**
We will use earned income up to the lower of the declared 'Anticipated Retirement Age' or a maximum working age of 75.

**Maximum Working Age of 70:**
The maximum working age applied will be 70 for:
- Remortgage applications with any capital raising/additional borrowing
- Applications with any amount on interest only
- Some purchase and remortgage applications because of the level of credit score achieved and overall credit profile

**Corrective Action Message:**
If a term past 70 years of age is selected for an application restricted to a maximum working age of 70, a Corrective Action message will fire a Decision in Principle (DIP): 'As the maximum working age on this application is 70 the term chosen extends into retirement, anticipated retirement income must be keyed or the term reduced to a maximum of … (years)'.

**Maximum Working Age of 75:**
The maximum working age applied will be 75 on product transfer and further advance applications.

**Occupational Considerations:**
The applicant's plans should be discussed in view of their occupation, and reasonability of working beyond state pension age should be documented where appropriate.

**Customer Working Age Form:**
- We will require a [Customer Working Age form](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/assets/pdf/customer-working-age-form.pdf "opens in a new tab") (PDF, 3.6MB) to be completed by all customers on an application where the mortgage term passes a working age of 70 for any customer
- This form asks the customer(s) to confirm they have considered the implications of the term chosen and that they believe they can continue to work until the age indicated
- The completed form will be required before we can proceed to offer

**Future Retirement Income Verification:**
Future retirement income will need to be verified where the customer is taking a mortgage term which extends beyond the lower of the declared 'Anticipated Retirement Age' or the maximum working age being applied.

### Min Time Employment and Self Employment

**Overview:**
Minimum time requirements for employment and self-employment verification.

**Employed:**
- Current employment details collected

**Self Employed:**
- 2 years history requested
- However, where the business has been trading for less than 2 years (e.g. 1 year self employed) and so self employed income is not available for 2 years, we will still consider these applications
- You must record all full relevant years' income accurately on the mortgage application
### Rental Income Keying

**Overview:**
All mortgage commitments should be keyed as commitments with 'Buy To Let' selected as mortgage type and the gross rental income keyed under Other income 'Rental Income – from Buy to Let properties owned'.

**Affordability Treatment:**
The Rental income will be used to offset the BTL mortgage payments but will NOT be used within the affordability calculation itself.

**Where the Property is Already Let:**

Rental income can be evidenced by any of the following documents:

- **Latest 3 months consecutive bank statements** (showing rental income)
  - Internet bank statements can be used providing the date, customer name, account number and bank heading is clearly displayed
- **Tenancy agreement**
  - Current agreement required, in date and must be signed by both tenants and landlord/letting agent
- **Letter from accountant or solicitor**
- **Letter from letting agent**
  - Statements of Account are NOT acceptable
  - The letter should be on company headed paper and confirm:
    1. The customer's name
    2. The rental income amount, frequency of payment, and that the income is still being received
    3. The address of the rental property
    4. Signed and dated
- **Valuation report**
  - If the Buy to Let is mortgaged, or being mortgaged with Lloyds Banking Group, a valuation report on file less than 6 months old can be used to show expected rental income

**If the Property is to be Let:**

Rental income can be evidenced by any of the following documents:

- Letter from the letting agent confirming the expected rental payment
- Letter from accountant or solicitor

**Restrictions:**
- We cannot accept rental income if the property is let to family or friends

**Unencumbered Properties Only:**

Rental income can be used in affordability calculations if:

- There are no mortgages secured on any let properties (all properties must be unencumbered)
- Your customer is declaring the income to the Inland Revenue and can evidence the rental income received by way of Tax Assessments and corresponding Tax Year Overviews
- The net profit declared from the rental properties should be treated as Self Employed income and keyed as a second job
- The Self Employed income must be completed for each of the last 2 years as applicable

If any of the following applies, the customer must be keyed as self employed;

For applicants who are classed as self-employed, you should capture all of their income under the field "Net Profit". Whilst some self-employed income we allow is not truly 'net profit', we use this field in our affordability assessment and in our policy rules. The Net profit field should be completed as following:
    * Limited company key total of salary/remuneration + dividends drawn (as shown on Tax Calculation)
    * Partnership (or LLP) key profit share (percentage of) Sole trader key net profits
    * Sole trader key net profits
We require self employed income details to be entered for the latest 2 years trading. Figures should only be entered for each full year of trading. Where the customer has been trading for less than 2 years but for at least one full year the application can be considered and accounts are then our preferred method of income verification. Additional information may be required to support any application.
We will accept self employed incomes which include government Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS) grant income.
The income level used in our affordability calculation will be the lower of the latest year or the average of the last 2 years.
A maximum LTI of 4.49x will apply on some applications where there is any element of self-employed income – please see our Affordability, LTI and Income Multiples criteria.

### Second Job

**Overview:**
In cases where the customer has more than one job, we will consider the following when deciding whether or not to take the secondary income into account.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Hours worked - are they sustainable?
- Are the roles/skills similar?
- What is the distance between the jobs and the customer's home?
- How long has the customer been in both jobs?
- Is the salary consistent with the type of employment?
- The number of days the customer works per week

**Income Treatment:**
Once all of the above has been taken into account and deemed acceptable, we will use the appropriate percentage of the second job income and it will be treated as per the standard income policy.


## Property Questions and Valuation

### Acceptable Property Types

**Overview:**
Each application will be assessed on its own merits although there are some property types which are specifically excluded.

**Do we lend on any property?**
No. We require experienced RICS (Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors) qualified surveyors to consider all the factors that may affect the suitability of a property to be mortgaged and whether or not it is readily saleable. Factors may include property construction, type, location, uses and environmental issues. Each case will be assessed on its own merits. Some property types such as houseboats, mobile homes and timeshares are specifically excluded.

**Do we lend on houses or flats/maisonettes made from precast reinforced concrete (PRC) that have been designated defective under the 1985 housing act?**
Generally not, unless the property has been repaired to a scheme that is approved by us. Flats/maisonettes which are designated defective PRC type are not acceptable.

**Do we lend on PRC properties that have been repaired but have no repair certificate?**
No. However, we will accept a 'retrospective repair certificate' confirming the repair has been undertaken to the standards laid down in the PRC Homes Repair Scheme or those accepted by us. The certificate must be in a format with wording required by us and prepared by a suitably qualified, experienced professional.

**Do we lend on non-traditionally constructed properties?**
Yes, subject to inspection and design. Each case is considered on its own merits.

**How big does the property have to be for a mortgage?**
Our general policy is to consider every property on its individual merits. We do not impose any size restrictions and no property is rejected solely on the grounds of size. A property must however meet the minimum criteria of being habitable, readily saleable and structurally sound.

**The property is situated above a shop/commercial property, is it suitable for a mortgage?**
There are no specific restrictions although some commercial uses may have a detrimental effect on saleability and every case is viewed on its own merits. The following guidance may be helpful:

- Any residential security must have a suitable access, which must not be through a business premises
- Caution must be exercised where the title of the residential property has been separated from a larger title that includes commercial activity, particularly when this has been done specifically for the purpose of the proposed mortgage. This can sometimes lead to an unusual residential property that may suit the proposed applicants but would be more difficult to sell on the open market. The residential security must meet the general principles regarding saleability
- The property must be self-contained, with its own private facilities and separate services

**Do we lend on high rise flats?**
Every case is viewed on its own merits, subject to construction and saleability. Certain types (e.g. large panel systems (LPS)) have specific requirements.

**Do we lend on properties with short leases?**
For leasehold properties to be acceptable, there must be a minimum of 70 years unexpired on the term of the lease at the time of the mortgage application.

**Do we lend on houses or flats with solar panels/photo voltaic cells?**
- We will not usually lend on blocks of leasehold flats where photo voltaic cells have been fitted, but there are some exceptions
- Houses with leased solar panels are acceptable for lending providing the agreed lease is acceptable to us. This will be confirmed through the conveyancer or by checking our approved list
- The valuer must be satisfied that the photo voltaic cells or solar panels have no impact on the structural integrity of the property and will be taken into account when assessing value and saleability  

### Assignable Contracts

**Overview:**
Applications which involve assignable contracts or irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of intervening sellers are not acceptable. Any other structure to the transaction which has a similar effect should be reported to us.

**Definition:**
Assignable contracts allow the original buyer to sell the property before legal completion, by assigning the contract to buy the property to a new buyer after contracts have been exchanged with the developer.

### Distressed Sale and Leaseback

**Overview:**
Applications that involve a distressed sale or a sale and leaseback are not acceptable.
### Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)

**Overview:**
- **Purchase applications:** Valid EPC details for the property are always required
- **Remortgages:** If the property has a valid EPC this must be captured, but if the property does not have a valid EPC the remortgage application can still proceed

**EPC Details Screen:**
When property details are completed, we will display on the EPC Details screen the latest EPC record to be used for the application. This EPC information comes from our database which is based on the Government EPC register.

**Keying Requirements:**
Please check the EPC showing is valid (within 10 years) and is the latest EPC available for the property. If the latest EPC is not showing, details will need to be keyed:

- Current Energy Efficiency Rating
- Potential Energy Efficiency Rating
- EPC Certificate/Reference Number
- EPC date field ('Valid Until' for England/Wales/NI or 'Date of Certificate' for Scotland)

**Checking EPC Register:**
The screen has a 'Check EPC Register' button to open the Government register to see if a new EPC record shows, otherwise please refer to the customer who may need to speak to the agent/vendor or developer/builder to obtain the necessary information.

**New Build Properties:**
For the purchase of new build properties, an EPC may not be available. We will accept a Predicted Energy Assessment (PEA) or Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) rating and these details should be keyed.

**Remortgage Applications:**
On remortgage applications, if an EPC does not exist for the property, EPC details do not need to be manually keyed.

**Proof of EPC:**
If EPC details are manually keyed and we request proof of the EPC, this must be uploaded with the other verification documents (e.g. EPC Certificate, PEA/SAP document for new build or where a property is 'exempt' a completed [exemptions template](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/assets/pdf/epc-exemption-form.pdf "Opens in a new tab") (PDF, 48KB)).

**Affordability Impact:**
A property's Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating is used in our affordability calculations, allowing us to reflect a more tailored view of energy costs. A customer whose property has a higher EPC rating (e.g. A/B) will generally have lower energy costs than those with a lower EPC rating (F/G) on like-for-like use.

**Loan Amount Impact:**
- **Properties with A/B EPC rating:** You may see a small increase in the maximum loan amount available
- **Properties with F/G EPC rating:** A small decrease
- **Properties with C, D or E EPC rating or where the EPC is unknown:** There is no change to the maximum loan available
### EWS1 and Cladding

**Overview:**
Due to provisions laid down under the Building Safety Act 2022, we will not require any further information on buildings containing 5 storeys and above in England and these applications can proceed as normal. For these properties, we will ask the purchaser's conveyancer to gather information relating to the current leaseholder as there may be some situations where a leaseholder may have to contribute to cladding remediation. These cases will be referred by the purchaser's conveyancer for us to review further.

**Wales:**
All high rise buildings in Wales (5 storeys or 11 meters and above) are eligible for remediation. We will not require any further information and these applications can proceed as normal.

**Scotland & Northern Ireland (All Buildings) and Buildings 4 Storeys and Below in England and Wales:**
In line with RICS guidance to valuers, we may ask for an EWS1 before a valuation figure can be provided. It is the responsibility of the building owner and/or its agent (in Scotland individual customers have to source the EWS1 form) as the responsible person to:

- Confirm that an external wall system (EWS) or attachments, such as a balcony, on buildings containing flats has been assessed by a suitable expert for likelihood of proportionate remediation to address fire safety risk
- The EWS1 form must be prepared by a fully qualified competent member of a relevant professional body. Please see 'Who carries out the EWS1 assessment, and what is their expertise?' on the [RICS Cladding External Wall System (EWS) FAQs](https://www.rics.org/news-insights/current-topics-campaigns/fire-safety/cladding-external-wall-system-ews-faqs)

**Valuation Requirement:**
We will be unable to confirm if a property is acceptable until a valuation has been instructed.

**Purchase Cases:**
For purchase cases, a special condition will be added to a mortgage offer to instruct the conveyancer to advise the customer that the offer has been made on the reliance of an EWS1. It will also ensure that the customer knows that neither ourselves nor surveying providers are liable for the information that was contained in the EWS1 form.

**New Build:**
For new build high rise blocks over 18m / 6 storeys in height (England & Wales) or 11m / 4 storeys in height (Scotland), Building Regulation compliance, The Building (Amendment) Regulations 2018 or local equivalent can be relied on, subject to the conveyancer receiving confirmation of this from the building owner, and/or its agent or duty holder. Where this cannot be obtained, the above criteria applies.
### Japanese Knotweed

**Unacceptable Construction Types:**
- Timber or metal framed buildings where the cavity, between frame & cladding, has been retrospectively filled with an insulation material
- Concrete walls as built in Cornwall or Devon before 1950 (1960 for postcodes PL12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 22 & 23) where valuer has recommended a Mundic report and test of the concrete has classified the concrete in either class B or C

**Leasehold Property:**
- For leasehold property, there must be a minimum of 70 years remaining on the lease at application, OR
- The customer is extending the lease past 70 years as part of the purchase or remortgage application (a special condition will be added to the offer stating the offer is made on the assumption that the lease term is extended on or before completion)
- Lease terms less than 70 years that are not to be extended are only accepted on certain central London estates and subject to specific criteria

**Leasehold with Freehold Share:**
- If a flat is leasehold and the applicant owns/will own on completion a share of the freehold of the whole building, the property should be keyed as leasehold and our charge will be registered on the leasehold interest only

**Freehold Flats:**
- Freehold flats are only considered where there are no more than four flats in the building
- The applicant must own the freehold personally in their own name and will own one unit in the building
- All other units must be subject to long leases (minimum 70 years)
- The security will be registered on the freehold of the whole building as a freehold house
- If the applicant's own flat also has a lease, the application would be for a leasehold flat and our charge must be registered on the freehold of the whole building and the leasehold interest of the unit

**Flying Freehold:**
- A flying freehold may be acceptable subject to surveyor guidance

**Freehold Reversion:**
- Freehold Reversion (also known as Tyneside, Cross-Referred and Mirror) leases should be keyed as leasehold flats

**Commonhold:**
- Commonhold property is not accepted

**Scotland:**
- The majority of properties in Scotland, including flats, hold the tenure 'Ownership Interest' which can be selected from the tenure dropdown list
- Please key £1 for ground rent and £1 for service charges/factor fees unless there is a charge, in which case you would key the amount actually paid
### Property Use

  - Specified age requirement
  - Specified employment types

- **Restricting use of property:**
  - Tied to agricultural use

**Impact on Acceptability:**
- The impact on acceptability depends upon the impact of the restriction
- There may be a strong local demand for the property from qualifying purchasers
- Broadly, restrictions that mean a property must be used for agricultural use will be unacceptable

**Assessment:**
- The valuer will determine the impact on the suitability of the property for lending
- The conveyancer will determine whether the purchaser / owner complies with the obligation, advising the bank if any issues that may impact the lending

**Time-Limited Occupancy:**
- Where the restriction limits the time a property can be occupied, this will only be acceptable for holiday homes / second home loans and subject to the valuer confirming the property is suitable for lending
### Scottish Properties

**Overview:**
Specific requirements and considerations for properties in Scotland.

**In Scotland how is property tenure keyed?**
The majority of properties in Scotland, including flats, hold the tenure 'Ownership Interest' which can be selected from the tenure dropdown list. Please key £1 for ground rent and £1 for service charges/factor fees unless there is a charge, in which case you would key the amount actually paid.

**In Scotland would a flat above shops (commercial subject) be classed as suitable security for mortgage purposes?**
Yes, subject to inspection, each on its own merits and subjective assessment against lending criteria, comments and valuation.

**In Scotland would a timber/metal clad house be acceptable?**
Yes, subject to inspection, each on its own merits and subjective assessment against lending criteria, comments and valuation.

**In Scotland is a retype on a new build or initial occupancy property permitted?**
No.

**In Scotland would a retype from a home report on a buy to let mortgage be permitted, if there is rental valuation on the original Generic Mortgage Valuation Report/Home Report?**
No. Following changes introduced by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Scotland) in early 2016, best practice advice is now that a rental valuation should not be provided in the Generic Mortgage Valuation Report attached to the Home Report.

**Do we lend on Scottish Islands?**
Yes, in the main although this is subject to demand and saleability.

**Would a retype for refinancing or remortgage purposes be accepted in Scotland?**
No.

**Do we accept a retype from any Home Report?**
The Home Report must have been completed by an approved Firm on our Panel with the appropriate postcode authorisation. The report must have the correct property address and the inspection date must be no more than 12 weeks from the date of the original report. All will be subject to inspection, subjective assessment against lending criteria and suitability.

**Do we accept a retype from a privately commissioned valuation report (regardless of level) in Scotland?**
No.

### Valuation Reports & Surveys
**Can my clients appeal the Valuation?**  
Yes they can, please [view our appeals process for more information](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/products/valuation-appeal-process.html).
**How long does it take for the valuation inspection to be carried out?**  
These are for guidance purposes only and depending on other factors such as property type and size they may vary. For a Level 1 Valuation it will take approximately 30-40 minutes. A Level 2 Survey and Valuation will take approximately 90 minutes to 2 hours.
**Where can I find information on your valuation fees?**  
[Details of our valuation fees](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/products/valuation-fees.html).
**Will the Surveyor need access to the property?**  
If the valuation is a Level 1 Valuation or Level 2 Survey and Valuation then access will be required to the property and arrangements will be made directly with the occupier or agent.
**Do you offer level 3 Building Surveys?**  
No. Your client can find a surveyor to complete this for them, we do not offer Building Surveys.
**Why are some instructions panelled?**  
E.surv are our surveyor of choice and wherever possible will carry out the valuation instruction. However where e.surv do not have coverage or to ensure we meet the needs of your clients, the instruction may be panelled to a member of e.surv's Valuation Panel who are administered by e.surv. Both e.surv and the valuation panel follow the same lender guidance provided by us and are audited on a regular basis.
**Why does my client need to sign the Terms of Engagement documentation you have sent them?**  
Terms of Engagement are issued in order to reflect accurately the scope of the service to be provided so that your client is in a position to fully understand what service the firm is providing to them. As such, a report cannot be released to them until the Terms of Engagement have been read, signed and returned by the client.
**Does my client need to provide the Surveyor with any paperwork when they visit the property?**  
No, the surveyor will have all the information they need.
**Does my client need to be present?**  
No, as long as there is a person over the age of 18 that can let the surveyor in. Alternatively the surveyor can collect the key from a neighbour or estate agent for example.
**Will the surveyor need access to the loft?**  
For Level 1 Valuation inspections access is generally not needed, although there may be occasions when the surveyor will want to have access to complete their investigations. Access will always be required for the Level 2 Survey.
**Is a copy of the Valuation Report sent to the solicitor?**  
E.surv surveyors are unable to release valuation reports directly to solicitors. If your client requires a copy by post, fax or email then they must request it directly from e.surv. Please be aware that we cannot send reports to solicitors or any other third party at your client's request. We can only issue the report directly to your client.
**Can I discuss an existing case with e.surv if I am not named on the application?**  
E.surv are only able to discuss valuation instructions with an applicant named on the case. The named applicant can authorise us to discuss the case with another party by calling and setting up a specific agreed security password.
**Does the Valuation Report contain an insurance or rebuild valuation figure?**  
No, an insurance figure is generally not provided on the report. Your client can obtain an insurance figure independently by visiting the Association of British Insurers (ABI) website. The ABI website has a residential rebuilding cost calculator. Your client will be required to register with the website but can then log in and obtain a rebuilding/insurance figure for free.
**What kind of comparable research on properties is used by the surveyor?**  
Our reports are provided in accordance with the RICS Valuation – Professional Standards. When preparing reports, valuers compare evidence of recent sales in order to provide an opinion of value at a specific point in time. Ideally comparables include properties within the immediate locality offering similar accommodation and style to that of the subject property.
However, comparable evidence need not be identical and it is sometimes the case that no direct comparable evidence is available. In such cases the valuer will use their experience to adjust for any variances in matters such as size, condition and specific location or geographical appeal. Valuers consider a wide range of comparable evidence and their research is thorough.
Details of properties currently on the market and valuations provided by estate agents do not relate to realised sale values. Also, estate agent marketing appraisals are prepared for a different purpose than mortgage valuation or survey reports. Such information cannot be considered in lieu of comparable sales evidence.
**My client has received an encrypted mail from e.surv, how do they open it?**  
All emails containing sensitive and confidential information are sent using the Symantec secure email encryption service. The initial email will contain a link which takes your client to the Symantec service so they can register as a new user, including creating their own password. Symantec is not compatible with mobile devices therefore a desktop or laptop computer will be required to [open the email (PDF, 547kB).](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/assets/pdf/secure-email-user-guide-short.pdf "PDF, opens in a new tab")
**Will my client be charged a fee if the valuation is cancelled?**  
A fee is not charged if the surveyor does not either visit the property or accept the instruction.
If the surveyor visits the property and finds it unsuitable they will complete a Level 1 Property Risk Assessment and confirm that they cannot give a valuation figure. They will point out that the property is unsuitable for lending and provide the reason. The valuation fee is payable in these circumstances.
**Will you report on the property's condition?**  
Level 1 Valuations are based on a limited inspection of the property highlighting only those items that are deemed to have a material impact on value. It is prepared in order for us to make an assessment of our loan to your client. It is not a survey of condition and is not designed to list individual property defects. It should not be relied on for their buying decision.
Level 2 Survey and Valuations report on specific condition matters and other issues to the extent outlined in the individual Terms of Engagement, which could affect a decision to buy. We base our lending decisions on the valuation aspects only.
**Why might my client need a specialist report?  
**Occasionally serious or potentially serious defects are found. The surveyor may not be able to provide a valuation without further investigation so a Specialist Report is requested. Serious defects warranting further investigation may include dry rot, structural movement, trees and drains but this is not an exhaustive list.
If a Structural Engineers Report is required this should be a focused report on the specific defect(s) referred to e.g. cracking, structural movement, subsidence, roof deflection, trees potentially causing damage, suspected drain failure etc. General reports on condition such as: Building Surveys, RICS Homebuyer reports etc. are not acceptable. The report must be addressed to our applicants and not the vendor, must detail the property address and must be signed off by a professional with the required qualifications, either:
    * Structural Engineer (with qualification M.I.C.E, F.I.C.E, IM.I Struct E, M.I. Struct E or F.I Struct E.)
    * Corporate Building/Corporate Structural Engineer (with qualification M.A.S.I., F.A.S.I, MBEng., FBEng., M.C.I.O.B. or F.C.I.O.B)
    * Chartered Building Surveyor (with qualification MRICS or FRICS).
For timber/dampness specialist reports the following qualifications are acceptable:
    * Property Care Association (PCA) - including specialists with a PCA recognized qualification: Certificated Surveyor in Remedial Treatments (CSRT) [widely now re-named. Certificated Surveyor of Timber & Dampness in Buildings (CSTDB)] or for dampness only Certificated Surveyor of Dampness in Buildings (CSDB).
    * Reports can also be considered from Non-PCA members provided any works are covered by an insurance.
For drainage reports the following qualifications are acceptable:
    * Member of the Institute of Civil Engineers (MICE/FICE)
    * Specialist drainage contractor.

**Financial Difficulty Categorisation:**
Financial difficulty is defined by the following categorisation:

1. **Budgetary Issues:** Able to afford current commitments and expenditure but poor at managing day to day control
2. **Overspending:** Able to afford current commitments but spending on non-essentials means an overall negative budget. Need to reduce spending in order to meet priority payments

5. **Over-indebted:** Unable to afford current commitments and unable to reduce spending to make priority payments and budget affordable. It may require the ability to make reduced repayments within concessionary repayment plans
6. **Severely Over-indebted:** Unable to afford current commitments and unable to restructure/reduce spending to bring budget into balance. Only has the ability to offer token repayments which are insufficient to meet a concessionary repayment plan or refinancing loan

### Overpayments & Payment Holidays

**Overpayments:**

**Overview:**
- Lump sum or regular overpayments can be made at any time
- If early repayment charges apply to the product, refer to early repayment charges for more details

**Payment Holidays:**

**Overview:**
- If your clients wish to take a payment holiday and if they meet criteria, it may be possible for them to take up to a maximum of 6 months over the lifetime of their mortgage
- One holiday is allowed every 3 years with a maximum of 2 months per instance

**Request Process:**
- A payment holiday can be requested for any reason and each circumstance should be individually assessed using questioning skills to establish if this is the correct method to support the customer
- It is very important that your client has not indicated they are in financial difficulty, and the purpose for the request is both reasonable and in their best interest
- It is important to remember that a payment holiday is a short term solution for short term need

**Important Considerations:**
- If your client does take a payment holiday, they need to be aware that the interest usually charged will be added to the balance of the mortgage
- Their account will be recalculated at the end of the payment holiday and written confirmation will be sent out approximately 2 weeks before their payment will restart
- The monthly payment will be calculated at that time using the higher balance and spread throughout the remaining term
- If they have any sub accounts on Interest Only, they need to be aware that these balances will increase to cover the amount of accrued interest that has been added due to the missed payments. Therefore, they will need to check that their repayment plan is on track to repay this mortgage at the end of the term

**Restrictions During Payment Holiday:**
- Whilst your client has an active payment holiday, they will be ineligible to apply for a Further Advance or a Mortgage Review
- They can only proceed with an application if they stop the payment holiday, or wait until it has ended

**Criteria:**
- The mortgage must have been open for at least 12 months with no further borrowing in the last 6 months
- The account must not be in arrears at the time of the application or have had any historic arrears on the account (in the last 12 months)
- The account must not have had any missed payments in the past 12 months
- There must be no payment arrangement in force or have been within the last 6 months
- The total debt on the mortgage must not exceed 75% at point of application; there will be the option for a revaluation (fee applicable)
- The mortgage property must not be on a Shared Ownership scheme
- The mortgaged property must be the Main Residence, and is not rented out
- Customer(s) must not currently be claiming on a Mortgage Repayments Insurance policy or be applying for, or be in receipt of, Income Support
### Porting Applications

**Overview:**
If an existing Halifax mortgage is repaid while an Early Repayment Charge (ERC) applies, this charge will be due unless the amount on the existing product is ported to a new application, when the ERC will be waived. The ERC can also be waived without porting, if a new mortgage is being taken in the last 3 months of the ERC period. In a non-simultaneous sale and purchase scenario, the ERC has to be paid but can be refunded as explained below.

**Notification Requirements:**
- Please notify us when you submit any new application for an existing Halifax mortgage customer, by advising the colleague when making an initial call or by [completing the Contact form (PDF, 35kB)](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/assets/pdf/contact-form.pdf "PDF, opens in a new tab") held on our Literature page and uploading this
- Please explain if the product is being ported or if not why, so we can take the necessary actions

**Product Portability:**
- If a product is portable, this is outlined in the original mortgage offer and supporting documentation
- You cannot port a product onto a remortgage application from another lender
- You can port to a remortgage of an unencumbered (mortgage free) property the customer already owns, where this will become their main residence

**Reversionary Rates:**
- Where Halifax Standard Variable Rate is the reversionary rate which applies to the product being ported, it will continue to be the reversionary rate for the amount of the new mortgage which is on the ported product
- Any extra amount borrowed on the new mortgage must be on a product from the current range and applicable scheme
- The reversionary rate which applies to that product and the amount on it will be Halifax Homeowner Variable Rate

**Simultaneous Completion:**
- To port a product, the new mortgage application must complete simultaneously with redemption of the current mortgage
- The conveyancer must indicate a product is being ported when they obtain a redemption statement for the existing mortgage
- The statement will then explain that the ERC does not need to be included in the redemption monies

**Partial Porting:**
- If the amount to be ported to a new loan is lower than the amount currently on the product, the ERC payable will be calculated on a pro rata basis
- **Example:** If £100,000 of £200,000 on the existing product is being ported, then 50% of the ERC would be charged
- If the new mortgage application is completing simultaneously with redemption of the current mortgage, only the partial ERC would need to be paid upon redemption

**Last 3 Months of ERC Period:**
- Within the last 3 months of an ERC period, the product does not need to be ported to a new mortgage
- As long as the new loan amount is not lower than the existing amount on the product with ERCs, a product from the new current range can be chosen for the new mortgage and the early repayment charge will be waived

**Non-Simultaneous Sale and Purchase:**
- Where a customer sells their property and repays their existing mortgage before they complete on a new purchase, they will incur any ERCs that apply
- However, if they apply for a new mortgage with us within three months of repaying their existing mortgage:
  - While they cannot port and would choose a new product from the current range at that time
  - Once the new mortgage has completed, we will process a refund of the ERC
- **Important:** This is a concession and it may not always be available
- The new loan amount must not be lower than the amount previously on the product, or a partial refund of the ERC will be received on a pro rata basis
- During the processing of the new application, you should tell us where a refund of an ERC will be required or [complete a Contact form (PDF, 35kB)](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/assets/pdf/contact-form.pdf "PDF, opens in a new tab")
- You should also call us when the new mortgage completes so we can request the refund of the ERC is actioned

**Buy to Let Restrictions:**
- Buy to Let mortgage products cannot be ported onto non Buy to Let mortgages

**How to Key to Port a Product:**
1. Make sure 'Existing Customer' has been chosen as 'Purchase Type' on Personal Details screen
2. On the Products selection screen, complete 'Roll number' or 'Account Number' with the customer's existing mortgage account:
   - **Roll number:** Their original application roll number - if the final digit after the dash is a single digit, remember to input a zero ahead of this (e.g. for 9 key '09'); 10/12345678-9 is keyed as 101234567809
   - **Account Number:** Key in a 14 digit format (e.g. 10/12345678-9 should be keyed as 10123456780900 including a zero ahead of the final digit if this is a single digit and two zeros at the end to make 14 digits)
3. Any products available to port will then show
4. Please ensure the customer's name, date of birth and address details are keyed correctly on the new application to exactly match the existing mortgage as shown in Mortgage Enquiry, for the portable product(s) to show available
### Product Transfers

**Overview:**
Please see our [**Product transfer**](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/placing-business/product-transfers-and-further-advances/product-transfer.html) page under Placing business for more information.

**Application Timing:**
- Product transfers (PT) applications can be submitted at any time in the month
- The earliest a product transfer can take effect is the 1st of the following month

**Forward Dating:**

- The new product will start on the 1st of the following month after the current product has ended

**Last 3 Months of Existing Product:**
- Where the customer is within the last 3 months of an existing product, you can choose to either:
  - Start the new product from the 1st of the following month and we will waive any Early Repayment Charge, OR
  - Forward date the new product to start after the current product has ended

**Arrears:**
- If a mortgage is in arrears, the account must be brought up to date before a PT application can be keyed

**Affordability Checks:**
We will be undertaking affordability checks on product transfers where there are material changes which affect affordability:
- Where the customer is lending into retirement
- Reducing their term on the Capital and Interest element of the mortgage
- Changing repayment type
- Where they do not have adequate repayment vehicles in place

**Documentation:**
- Any documentation requested must be received in sufficient time for the product transfer to be offered before the end of the month prior to the date of effect
### Retirement Home Plan (RHP)/ Lifetime

**Overview:**
Customers should contact Halifax on 0345 727 3747 in the first instance where they will be provided with details of how to progress their requirements.

### Subsequent Charges (SCG)

**Overview:**
If a SCG is present, your local processing centre will contact you if there is a problem with the SCG type or problems in obtaining a Letter of Postponement (LOP).

**SCG Reasons That Prevent Further Advance:**
If any of the following SCG reasons are present, the further advance cannot proceed:

- Bankruptcy inhibition
- Bankruptcy order
- Creditors notice
- Drug trafficking offence
- Receiving order
- Sequestration

**Non-Clearing Bank SCG:**
- If the SCG is registered to a non-clearing bank and is to be repaid, a conveyancer must be instructed

**Letter of Postponement (LOP):**
- If the client does not intend to repay the SCG using the further advance and will therefore continue after completion, Halifax will request a Letter of Postponement (LOP) from the SCG lending company
- If the LOP is not granted, the further advance cannot proceed
- It is not unusual for the SCG lending company to refuse to grant an LOP


## Applications Pre & Post Submission Help

### Appeal Credit Score Decline

**Overview:**
All applications will be credit scored. If an application is declined as it has not passed the credit score, customers have a right to appeal and whilst we'll always reconsider carefully, without new information it is very unlikely that we will be able to change our decision.

**Policy Declines:**
This also applies where an application is declined on policy because of:
- 'The level of unsecured debt outstanding', OR
- 'An active pay day loan is present'

**Appeal Consideration:**
Please give careful consideration before submitting an appeal for assessment. The list below provides guidance on the scenarios in which an appeal may be successful:

**Scenarios Where Appeals May Be Successful:**

**Existing Halifax Mortgage Customers:**
- Moving house with no increase in loan amount or loan to value (LTV) compared with the current mortgage

**BFPO Address:**
- The client is in the British Armed Forces and living at a BFPO address

**Victim of Fraud:**
- The fraud has been reported to the Police and Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance system (CIFAS) and can be evidenced by a crime reference number

**Adverse Credit Data Registered in Error:**
- An error by Lloyds Banking Group can be evidenced
- If the adverse information has been registered on a non-Lloyds Banking Group product, an appeal cannot be submitted and the customer should arrange for their records to be corrected before a new application is submitted

**Other Scenarios:**
- For scenarios that fall outside of this list, it is likely the final decision will remain unchanged

**Further Information:**
- Please refer to our [Credit Scoring leaflet (PDF, 173KB)](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/assets/pdf/credit-scoring.pdf "PDF, opens in a new tab")

**Further Advances:**

- **Repayment Type:** All borrowing above 85% LTV must be on a repayment basis (no interest only)
### Concessionary and Family Purchase

**Overview:**
The property purchase is solely for the applicant(s) to live in as their main residence and the applicant is:

**Eligible Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1:**
- Purchasing from an immediate family member (see definition below) or partner/ex-partner at a discounted price
- Minimum of 10% discount is required
- The vendor must move out on completion

**OR**

**Scenario 2:**
- A sitting tenant purchasing from their landlord (private or council) at a discounted price
- Minimum of 10% discount is required
- This excludes Right to Buy
- The tenant must have been subject to a tenancy agreement on the property for a minimum of 1 year

**Permitted Relationships:**
The only relationships permitted for a concessionary purchase are (including vice versa):

- Parents, step-parents, adoptive parents
- Applicant's children, step-children, half children, adopted children
- Brothers and sisters, half brothers and sisters, step-brothers and sisters
- Grandparents, step-grandparents
- Grandchild, step-grandchild
- Aunt/Uncle
- Partners or ex-partners who are not co-habiting at the property

**Requirements:**
- All family purchase transactions must provide vacant possession (the vendor must be moving out) on completion
- In all cases, the discount on the purchase price must be a minimum of 10% of the market value
- The discount must be a genuine discount (must not be subject to any future repayment, clawback or retained interest terms)

**Inherited Properties:**
For inherited properties where a beneficiary is purchasing the other beneficiaries share, this should be keyed as a concessionary purchase. The purchase price will be the amount required to buy out the other beneficiaries.

**Example:**
Mr Smith has died leaving the property valued at £200,000 to his two sons; therefore each beneficiary has a share of £100,000. Only one son wants the property and wishes to buy out the brother's shares. In this scenario, the purchase price would be £100,000 as the applicant already owns 50% of the property.

**Valuation Requirements:**
A valuation must be instructed in all cases including properties in Scotland (retypes are not permitted).

**Important Note:**
As the application results can differ on these cases once the correct purchase price has been keyed, you must contact The Halifax Intermediary Processing Team for all applications for Concessionary Purchase. This will ensure correct underwriting of the case has been carried out at the time of application.
### First Homes Scheme

**Overview:**
The Government First Homes scheme in England allows First Time Buyers (FTB) to purchase a New Build property at a discounted purchase price under a Resale Price Covenant (RPC). The discount (which will be a minimum 30%) must be passed on if the property is sold in the future.

**Key Eligibility Criteria for First Homes Scheme:**
- All applicants must be a First Time Buyer. Local Authorities may prioritise key workers, local residents and service personnel
- In England only
- New Build properties only
- Maximum purchase price, after discount, is £250,000 (£420,000 in London)
- Discount typically 30% but Local Authorities can increase up to 50%
- Customer maximum income of £80,000 (£90,000 in London)

**Mortgage Criteria:**
- Minimum 5% personal deposit based on discounted purchase price
- First Homes scheme specific products must be selected (for remortgages Affordable Housing remortgage range applies)
- Mortgage must be on a capital and interest repayment basis, no interest only
- Minimum 50% Loan to Value (LTV) based on discounted purchased price

**Example:**
- Full market valuation = £100,000
- Discount of 30% (but could be higher) = £30,000
- Discounted purchase price = £70,000
- Customer deposit required = £3,500 (5% of £70,000)
- Maximum Loan = £66,500
- LTV for product selection = 67% (£66,500 loan against £100,000 full market value)

**Deposit and Incentives:**
A 5% personal deposit is required in addition to any incentives from the builder. The loan amount together with any incentives and any product fee being added, cannot exceed 95% of the discounted purchase price. For product selection, the percentage LTV used will be loan amount against the full market value (not discounted purchase price).

**Application Process:**
- On Halifax Intermediaries Online, the 'First Homes' scheme should be selected on the Scheme screen and you will then be asked to key the percentage discount
- On the Loan screen, key the discounted purchase price
- The customer should obtain an Authority to Proceed (ATP) from the Local Authority
- A Decision In Principle (DIP) can be keyed before ATP has been obtained by selecting the new scheme
- A full application should only be submitted after ATP has been granted

**Mortgage Offer:**
A Special Condition on the mortgage offer will state that an RPC will apply to the property. Affordable Housing Scheme Guidance Notes will be issued automatically to the conveyancer with the offer.

**Remortgages:**
Remortgages of properties initially purchased under the First Homes scheme are accepted:
- Please select the First Homes scheme and key the percentage (%) discount applied when the property was originally purchased
- On the Loan screen, key the estimated property value after the percentage discount is applied
- **Example:** If the estimated full market value is £250,000 and a 40% discount applied when the property was initially purchased, key £150,000 as the estimated property value
- Products should be selected from the Affordable Housing Remortgage range
- The loan to value (LTV) for selecting the product is the loan amount against the full market value

**Product Transfer (PT) and Further Advance (FA) Applications:**
- Please see the Product Finder within Mortgage Enquiry for the available products
- The loan to value (LTV) for product selection will be the loan amount against the full value of the property
- Further advance applications are not available until a mortgage has been open for 6 months
- The maximum 85% LTV for FA applications is based on the loan amount against the property valuation after the percentage discount is applied

**Other RPC Schemes:**
We continue to accept RPC schemes which are not part of the First Homes initiative. Please see [Resale Price Covenant (RPC) criteria](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria.html#resale_price_covenant_and_discount_market_scheme).
### First Time Buyers (FTB)

**Overview:**
To qualify for a FTB product, one applicant must not have previously had a mortgage or purchased a property (including bought for cash) either in the UK or abroad.

**Classification:**
- In instances where an applicant has owned (such as inherited) but not previously bought a property, they are classified as a FTB
- For joint applicants, only one applicant needs to be a FTB to qualify for a FTB product
### Mortgage Prisoner

**Overview:**
Customers classed as Mortgage Prisoners by the FCA due to their current mortgage being held with a closed book lender may be able to remortgage to the Halifax. Applications will be subject to our criteria, credit scoring and affordability assessment.

**When Affordability Assessment Fails:**
If a remortgage application passes our credit score but fails our affordability assessment, we may still be able to consider the application. The customer must be remortgaging from a closed book lender and have received a letter from their existing lender stating they are classed as a Mortgage Prisoner.

**Required Criteria:**
The remortgage application would need to meet the following criteria:

- A remortgage of the customer's main residence with no additional borrowing (excluding any fees)
- Maximum 75% loan to value (LTV)
- Interest Only lending is acceptable subject to verification of acceptable repayment plans for the whole amount of interest only per our normal criteria
- The customer's new monthly payment must be no more than 5% higher than the current monthly payment
- The mortgage cannot be on a Shared Equity or Shared Ownership scheme
- The customer must not be in Financial Difficulty. Please [see the definition of 'Financial Difficulty'](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria.html#financial_difficulty)

**Application Process:**
If an Alternative Lending Proposal (ALP) application result is received, this indicates the application has passed our credit score but failed the affordability assessment. If all of the above criteria are met:

- Please select the 'Mortgage Prisoner' scheme in Halifax Intermediaries Online and submit the full application
- You should complete and upload the [Mortgage Prisoner form (PDF, 124kB)](https://www.halifax-intermediaries.co.uk/assets/pdf/mortgage-prisoner-form.pdf "PDF, opens in a new tab") and all required documentation

**Review Process:**
Even if the above criteria are met, the level of credit score achieved will be considered and the application will still be subject to a full review before we can confirm if we are able to proceed.

**Important Considerations:**
- It is important the customer has checked if there are any other financial interests registered against the property (for example if there is a second charge or charging order) and if so that these will either be removed or postponed so that Halifax has a first charge
- In many cases, due to the nature of the interest, it will be clear from the outset that postponement is not possible and it will be necessary for the debt to the third party to be repaid on or before completion
- If it becomes apparent that the Halifax mortgage cannot be registered as a first charge because of any third party interest in the property, the new mortgage will not be able to proceed

This is a restriction to ensure that the "Discount" is always passed on to future buyers.

**Alternative Name:**
- Discount Market Scheme (DMS) is another name for RPC

**Scheme Requirements:**
- We will only accept a scheme where the resale price is based upon a certain percentage of market value and not on a house price and/or income index

- Only if the customer will never pay any interest should a zero figure be keyed

**Example:**

**80/20 Shared Equity purchase:**

- Amount of equity retained by the builder/shared equity loan provider = £20,000 (20% of £100,000 full value)
- Rate of interest payable (confirmed by customer) = e.g. 4%
- £20,000 x 4% = £800 per annum
- £800 / 12 = £67 to be keyed in 'Monthly interest payments' field
