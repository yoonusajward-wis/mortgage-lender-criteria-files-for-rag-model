## Acceptable Income

We accept various types of income for mortgage applications. Please refer to the "Income Documents" section for details on acceptable income types and required documentation. Income from employment, self-employment, pensions, and certain benefits may be considered subject to our affordability assessment.

## Affordability

We assess all applications on the applicant(s) ability and willingness to meet obligations. We will not grant credit facilities on the basis of security. The term of any facility must be in line with the purpose for which it is granted.

When analysing the applicant's creditworthiness, you must consider their:
  * present ability to repay the loan
  * future ability to repay the loan
  * willingness to repay the loan

In order to ensure that the customer can afford to repay their mortgage in the event that interest rates increase we also undertake a stress test to show the effect of this of their mortgage repayment. Before you submit an application, you must use our affordability calculator to check if the applicant meets the following criteria.
  * Net Disposable Income (including stress test)
  * LTV
  * Debt Service Ratio

## Arrangement Fee

The arrangement fee may be added to the loan or can be paid directly by client, subject to LTV and LTI restrictions. Please contact us for more information.

If a mortgage is portable it will be outlined in the customers current Mortgage Illustration and Mortgage Offer Document.
**To port a mortgage:**
The existing loan can be closed and the new loan opened on the same day, at which point we will waive the Early Repayment Charge on closure of the existing loan.
In cases where it is not possible to complete both loans on the same day:
  * A new offer must be in place.
  * The existing loan may be closed prior to the new loan being opened.
  * The customer will be charged the Early Repayment Charge in full on closure of the existing loan. The ERC will be refunded if the new loan is drawn down within the offer period.
  * The new loan can then be drawn down at any point during the Offer Period.

**Important**
The customer will no longer be eligible for a refund of any Early Repayment Charge taken if:
  * The loan is not completed within the Mortgage Offer Period.
  * During the Offer Period, either we or the customer decide not to proceed with the offer a new mortgage.

Only the outstanding amount, rate and fixed rate end date (if applicable) can be ported. Any additional borrowing required will be treated as a new mortgage.
Customers may take the new loan over their existing term or choose to increase or reduce the term in line with their needs.

You may be able to find a property’s rating on the UK Government's Find an energy certificate page (GOV.UK) .
