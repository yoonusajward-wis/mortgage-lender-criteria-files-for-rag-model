================================================================================
## A-Z Lending Criteria
================================================================================

### Lending Criteria A 

###  Acreage/Agricultural restriction 
We don't have a maximum plot size.

Where a property is over 4 hectares/10 acres, we will be able to consider the property subject to underwriter assessment and a suitable valuation report.
Agricultural restrictions limit the occupancy of a property to persons employed in an agriculture related job. Residential applications for the purchase or remortgage of a customer’s main residence where an agricultural restriction is in place may be considered subject to:
• The applicant must be employed in an agricultural related job; however their primary source of income must not be related to the mortgaged property.
• Maximum Loan to Value (LTV) is 50%.

###  Additional Borrowing Purposes 
We can consider additional borrowing for a wide range of purposes. Common examples of additional borrowing include:

* Debt Consolidation
* Home Improvements
* Purchase of another property

We will need to know the intended property being purchased and any future mortgage commitments. The underwriter may request: 
  * A copy of the sale particulars or memorandum of sale.
  * A KFI or mortgage offer, where this will be mortgaged.
  * An ARLA letter where a rental property is being purchased.

**_Buy to Let / Consent to Let_**
Where a customer requests additional borrowing on a Buy to Let or Consent to Let property, the following circumstances can’t be considered:
  * Gambling
  * Any form of business purpose (i.e. start up for a new business but please note this does not include buying a buy to let in a limited company name)
  * Unsecured Debt Consolidation. 

For more information on Additional Borrowing, please visit our dedicated hub here: [Additional Borrowing Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/additional-borrowing.html).

###  Additional Income 
Where the customer is in receipt of regular additional income as part of their employment, you should understand the nature of this income to ensure it is considered a variation of acceptable income types (see [Income and Packaging Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/income-and-packaging.html))**,** not an expenses related payment and that current levels will continue long term.
Further information on Additional Incomes/Occupations can be seen in the A-Z that include:
· Long Term Town Allowance
· NHS Bank
· Pilot/Cabin crew
· Shift Allowances
· Seafarers
· Tips/Tronc

###  Adverse Credit 
We consult multiple credit reference agencies to look at credit and bank account conduct.

We will not consider applications from individuals who have declared Insolvent in the past 6 years. Insolvency includes:
  * Bankruptcy or Sequestration
  * Individual Involuntary Arrangement (IVA) or Protected Trust Deeds
  * Debt Relief Orders or Minimal Asset Process

Alternative adverse history may be considered subject to [credit scoring](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/lending-criteria.html#C), bank account conduct and underwriting.

Additionally, within the application we ask:  
In the last 6 years has your client(s) had a debt repayment plan with creditors, been declared bankrupt or had a county court judgement against them?

If the answer is 'yes' to this question, we are unable to accept the application.

###  Affordability Calculators 
Our affordability calculators can give a good indication of the amount we would be willing to lend.

Our affordability calculators don't conduct a credit search and as such the indicative lend for residential applications is potentially subject to change when the agreement in principle is submitted. See 'Loan to Income' for more information.

Our calculators, applicable to both residential and additional residential borrowing, require details of your client's overdraft balances, mail orders and budget accounts. These figures do not need to be included in the decision in principle or full mortgage application as they will be automatically verified through credit bureau data.

We will use the most recent credit bureau data to determine the lending amount provided at the time of the decision in principle or full mortgage application, which will be the final amount and can't be appealed.

###  Age Requirements 
Applicants must be at least 18 years old at the time of application. Maximum age will be based on the oldest applicant.
**Residential**
  * For Capital and Interest loans the maximum age at the end of the term is 75 (or intended retirement age, whichever is sooner).
  * For Interest Only or Mixed (part and part) loans the maximum age at the end of the term is 70 (or intended retirement age, whichever is sooner).
  * Please see [Lending into retirement- residential](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/lending-criteria.html#L).

**Buy to Let**
  * For Small Landlords and Portfolio Landlords the maximum age at the end of the term is 80.
  * For customers who are non-owner occupiers/First time buyers, the maximum age is retirement age or 80 (whichever is lower).
  * Please see [Lending into retirement- Buy to Let](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/lending-criteria.html#L).

Please see [Term](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/lending-criteria.html#TU) for more information on this.

###  Applicants (number of) 
The maximum number of applicants is two.

###  Annual percentage rate of charge (APRC) 
The APRC is all fees associated with the mortgage, whether added to the advance or not. This includes application fees, product fees, arrangement fees, booking fees, CHAPS and Telegraphic Transfer fees, fees charged by intermediaries, mortgage exit administration fees (sealing fees) and valuation fees. It is included on the Mortgage Illustration.
There is an additional cost illustration, known as the second APRC. The second APRC presents a stressed interest rate scenario and illustrates what the product APRC would be if bank base interest rates rise to their 20-year high. Mortgages with a fixed rate for the entire term of the deal will not require this illustration.
We calculate the new APRC and second APRC in accordance with the guidance received from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) and include both in the Mortgage Illustration.

###  Armed Forces personnel 
Unsecured personal loans are only acceptable for Armed Forces personnel who are eligible for a Forces Help to Buy (FHTB) loan which is an interest-free loan repayable over 10 years:
  * This will be allowed to be used towards an applicant's deposit but the monthly repayment as detailed on the Ministry of Defence ‘Personal Information Note’ must be included in outgoings for affordability.
  * The FHTB loan may not be used for the purchase of a second property, including a buy-to-let property. 

### Lending Criteria B 

###  Background Buy to Lets 
Where the customer has any background properties that they let out, you need to tell us about this on the application. Please key the full property details including any unencumbered properties in the 'Other existing mortgages/properties' section of the application.
  * To use surplus rental income for affordability, please see [Rental Income](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/income-and-packaging.html#O-R "https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/income-and-packaging.html#o-r"). This is only acceptable on residential applications.
  * If the property is self-financing (rental income covers the mortgage payment) but you don’t want to use any rental income to support affordability, this is acceptable. In this situation we will exclude the mortgage commitment from affordability. 
  * Should the property run at a loss e.g. the rental income received is less than the mortgage payment creating a shortfall, please key the shortfall amount on the application under Expenditure > Other financial commitments.

Our underwriter reserves the right to ask for supporting documentation to validate what has been keyed on the application. 

###  Back to Back / Day 1 Remortgage 
Back to back is typically where the vendor has owned the property for less than six months, or remortgages where they've owned the property for less than six months.
Solicitors are required to disclose any transaction in the last six months and, if this happens, cases will be declined after offer unless the circumstances meet one of the following situations in which lending may be considered:
  * **Customer funded purchase:** the customer has funded the original purchase using their own funds or funds from a close family member and are now looking to set up a mortgage to replenish their own personal savings or to repay the close family member. The lending would be restricted to the lower of the original purchase price or valuation. Proof of original savings or monies being lent by the family member may be required.
  * **Bridging:** residential mortgage applications where the customers required a bridging loan due to delays in selling the existing property, subject to normal underwriting. The previous property has now been sold and the applicants are looking for a mortgage on the new property with funds to be used to repay the bridging loan. Buy to let applications are not acceptable in this situation.
  * **Inherited:** a recently inherited property where the beneficiary wishes to release some of the equity for residential or buy to let purposes, or to buy the shares in the property inherited by others (e.g. siblings or joint beneficiaries). We will also consider lending where our customer wishes to purchase the property from a vendor who recently inherited the property. 
  * **Porting:** where a fixed or discounted rate was ported to a new property but is now expiring/has expired and the customer wants to remortgage within the 6 month period to gain a new rate. Proof of the rate roll off has to be obtained for example mortgage offer or rate roll off letter from the previous lender.
  * **Repossessed property:** where the vendor is the mortgage lender in possession i.e. the property has been repossessed within the last six months and is being sold by the mortgage lender or their agent. This does not include repossessed properties being purchased cheaply at auction and then sold on by a third party. 
  * **Part exchange:** where the vendor is a large national house builder selling a property acquired under a part-exchange scheme.

###  Bank statements 
We can accept bank statements providing:
  * All of your customers details (full name, address, bank details) are clearly visible and match the details on your application.
  * It is the customers full statement and is not filtered (either postal statement or online banking download. The online statements do not have to be certified by the issuing bank)
  * You supply the full statements for the months we've requested.
  * Screenshots cannot be accepted, please upload the original document.

When keying please key 100% of the amount received and we will use 50% of this. Please note that where the latest years' bonus was lower the underwriter will use 50% of the most recent year's bonus.
For guaranteed bonuses we will consider an average of the last 2 years' payments (cash element only) and use 100% of it in our affordability calculation.

The age of an applicant's children may be a factor. We require the awards letter as part of the application packaging. If the benefit will end for one or more of the children in the next 5 years, consideration should be given to if and how the customer can replace this income. If the income will not be replaced, then this element of the benefit should not be used.

If any party to the application receives an income of greater than £60,000 - Child Benefit must not be included.

• [Universal Credit](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/lending-criteria.html#TU)

###  Childcare costs 
We use the actual amount the customer has declared they pay in our affordability calculations for this commitment. Customers with dependants will be asked about the type of childcare they use, how often and how much they spend.
  * No evidence is required upon submission, where we identify costs that differ to costs declared on the application, the underwriter may ask further questions to confirm correct figures.
  * Childcare costs should be considered over the next 5 years and the highest cost should be used for affordability.
  * Where the customer is currently pregnant, on maternity leave or if childcare arrangements are yet to be made. Customers can suggest likely future costs or you can refer to the national average figures [here](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/content/dam/natwest_com/Intermediary/PDFs/Childcare_average_pdf.pdf).

**When should childcare costs not be included?**
There are several situations where childcare cost should not be captured in the affordability calculations. These include but are not limited to:
• Where customers are using free childcare e.g. a relative to look after their child.
• Where the childcare costs are stopping within the next 6 months (if reducing within the next 6 months please include reduced amount).
• Where the customer benefits from free childcare hours.
• Where a customer is proactively using a childcare provider as a developmental experience and the costs are discretionary.

###  Cladding 
We rely upon the professional opinion of our valuers to confirm if a property shows the presence of potentially combustible cladding or if there are other fire safety concerns. Should they feel this is the case, where confirmation of remediation is not available through Government Remediation data or an EWS1/FRAEW is not already available for a building, the valuer may request an EWS1 form or FRAEW (Fire Risk Assessment of External Walls).
All valuations remain subject to valuer’s comments. For further details, please see our [Property and Valuations Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/property-and-valuations.html#cladding).

###  Commission 
We can consider accepting up to 100% of commission. Evidenced by the last 3 months consecutive payslips showing commission payments. Year to date income should support.
Where this is paid weekly the latest 13 payslips will be required.

###  Committed expenditure 
For details of committed expenditure please refer to the ‘[Financial Commitments](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/lending-criteria.html#F)’ section.

###  Consent to Let 
Consent to Let can be requested by a customer if they are looking to rent out their property on a temporary basis. The Bank's consent must always be sought by a customer prior to renting out their property and the customer will continue to benefit from our standard residential mortgage rates. If agreed, we will issue a letter of consent to the letting of the property and will charge an initial administration fee and an annual fee, which will start on the anniversary of the Consent To Let being agreed.
  * Customers must have had their mortgage with us for a period of no less than 6 months (unless they are in the Armed Forces, working abroad for the Foreign or Commonwealth office or living in Tied Accommodation e.g. boarding school teacher, vicar/minster or estate worker) - this is relevant for both existing and new customers. 
  * Customers must not have a Consent To Let on any other properties mortgaged with us.·
  * The fee is £120 initial payment and £120 per annum payable on the anniversary of our agreement to Consent to Let. The fees are waived for (1) customers in the armed forces (2) Customers in Tied Accommodation and (3) customers working abroad for the Foreign & Commonwealth Office.

Should your customer wish to arrange this, please ask them to log on to [Manage Your Mortgage](https://www.natwest.com/mortgages/existing-customers.html) or call: 0345 302 0190.
Please note: Customers in the Armed Forces, working abroad for the Foreign or Commonwealth office or living in Tied Accommodation must contact us once their mortgage is live to arrange the Consent to Let.
If your customer intends to let out their property for less than 90 days in a rolling 12-month period, they might not need to notify us. For a full list of terms they can visit our [consent to let webpage](https://www.natwest.com/mortgages/existing-customers/consent-to-let.html).

### Lending Criteria C (continued) 

###  Construction types 
For information on this, please see our [Property and Valuations Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/property-and-valuations.html#construction).

###  Consumer Buy to Let 
Consumer Buy to Let is a type of regulated business introduced by the MCD to provide enhanced protections where Buy to Let customers are not acting for business purposes.
Our approach to identifying a consumer Buy-to-Let is based on how the customer views their Buy to Let activity. Where the customer intends to benefit from house price growth and rental income we will class this as investment purposes and can consider a BTL mortgage, as we will not treat it as a consumer BTL.
We **don’t** offer consumer BTL mortgages.
Sourcing Tip – If property will be used as an investment property, ensure that sourcing isn’t filtered by Consumer Buy to Let so that NatWest appears on your sourcing.
For more information, please see our [Buy to Let hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/btl-hub.html?intcam=#consumer). 

###  Contractors 
We support customers who are contractors and have dedicated information on our [Contractors hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/contractors.html), including:
  * [PAYE Contract Workers including Zero hour and Agency workers](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/contractors.html#paye).
  * [Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/contractors.html#cis).
  * [Umbrella Company Contractor](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/contractors.html#umbrella).
  * [High Income / Day Rate Contractors](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/contractors.html#high-income).

###  Credit scoring 
Credit scoring is a statistical tool used to assess an applicant for credit facilities and ranks applicants by probability of default. All applicants will be assessed using credit score and credit reference information obtained from multiple credit reference agencies in addition to one or more of the following:
  * Information supplied as part of the application process.
  * Internal data relating to existing account(s) with the group.

We can't process appeals for adverse credit scores unless this is a like-for-like (or less) borrowing on a **_residential_**

###  Concessionary Purchase 
Please see [Proof of deposit](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/income-and-packaging.html#deposit).
**Gifted deposit letter** - This will be required in all gifted deposit circumstances. There is a template letter in the forms and guides section of the website. [Gifted Deposit Letter](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/content/dam/natwest_com/Intermediary/PDFs/2022-12-16GiftedDepositLetterSRFINAL.docx).

###  Change of Property 
You can amend the property details on an existing case providing the application was submitted less than 6 months ago or the original offer is not more than six months old. Where the application falls outside of these timescales, a new application will be required using our current new business product range.

To amend the property details you will need to complete [this form](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/content/dam/natwest_com/Intermediary/PDFs/2023-05-04ChangeOfPropertFormSRFINAL.pdf "https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/content/dam/natwest_com/intermediary/pdfs/2023-05-04changeofpropertformsrfinal.pdf"). You may need to provide up to date packaging. The case will be reassessed and recredit scored based at the time of requesting the change.

### Lending Criteria D 

###  Debt Consolidation 
Debt consolidation is where a customer wishes to clear **existing debts** as part of a new business or additional borrowing application.
The maximum LTV that we offer for Debt Consolidation is 80%.
The below table outlines what we do and do not classify as debt consolidation.

Where funds are being raised on a remortgage to NatWest to repay and consolidate existing debt, you do not need to include this debt as a commitment on the affordability calculator. We will disregard these commitments from affordability in this scenario. Please ensure you still include these debts in the ‘Expenditure’ section of the AIP and Full Application and then select the option to confirm that debts will be repaid.  

###  Dependants 
A dependant is any person who relies on the customer financially for things like money, clothes or food, whether living at the property or not. This includes financially dependent partners not named on the mortgage, children under 18, those in higher education, and financially dependent elderly relatives.
Where the customer pays maintenance for a child, they should not be listed as a dependant.
If your customer is expecting a child, e.g. currently pregnant or has approval to adopt, then this extra dependant must be included when assessing affordability.

###  Deposit 
Please see [Proof of deposit](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/income-and-packaging.html#deposit).  

###  Diplomatic immunity 
We cannot lend to anybody working in the UK who has or may have diplomatic immunity under the Geneva Convention or inter-government treaties. This applies at all LTV levels, and is because the application would be immune from UK laws and we wouldn't be able to enforce repossession.

### Lending Criteria E 

###  Early repayment charges 
An Early Repayment Charge will be incurred on any overpayment that exceeds the annual 20% limit. Please refer to the early repayment section of your Mortgage Illustration or offer document for information on early repayment charges that would be incurred if any overpayment exceeds the annual 20% limit.
The year runs from the date the mortgage was taken out (or your customer's current product) and the 20% includes all sub accounts and is specific to each of these that makes up the mortgage.
If customers reduce their ported balance then a partial ERC must be paid for the amount that the borrowing is being reduced by, less any overpayment allowance, if it is tied into a product at the time of redemption. 
For further guidance on Porting click [here](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/porting.html).
To see the ERC’s on current products, please review our [Product Guide](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/products.html#currentproducts). 

###  Employment Length 
For an employed applicant, we require 6 months continuous employment. We class it as continuous where there is no break of more than 3 weeks between employments. 
If self-employed, two full years trading is required. For contract workers, please visit our [Contractor Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/contractors.html).
Where the customer is a graduate and secured employment in a relevant field, the application may be considered without 6 months continuous employment, subject to underwriting. 
Please also see ‘Pay rise/Change of Income or Job (Employed income only)’ in our [Income and Packaging Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/income-and-packaging.html#L-N).

### Lending Criteria F 

###  Family-backed Mortgage 
A NatWest Family-Backed Mortgage could allow a family member, or a friend increase the mortgage borrowing amount available, helping even more customers in making their dream of owning a home become a reality. It allows a joint application, where only one applicant will be the proprietor. This is often known as Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor.
**Eligibility:**
· Standard residential mortgage policy rules will apply to all applicants, which includes our eligibility criteria of minimum age of 18 to maximum age of 75.
· Maximum number of applicants remains at two. This is due to system restraints.
· Applying for the mortgage to purchase the property on a residential basis, with no intention to let it out.
· We require a minimum income of £20k gross per annum for the main applicant/owner. This can be made up of all acceptable income types.
· We will only use the ‘considered’ amount of income when assessing the £20,000 eligibility, e.g. 50% of annual discretionary bonus.
· The non-owning borrower must seek independent legal advice before completion. An Independent Legal Advice Certificate will be sent to the non-owning borrower with the mortgage offer, seeking confirmation legal advice has been obtained.
· This is not available with mortgage schemes such as Right to Buy and Shared Equity.
Please see our NatWest [Family-backed mortgage hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/family-backed-mortgage.html) for more detail.

###  Family purchase 
Please see 'gifted equity/concessionary purchase', under [Proof of deposit](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/income-and-packaging.html#deposit).

###  Fees and charges 
  * **Product fee:** this is the fee payable for the selected product and can be added to the loan. Adding this fee to the loan **doesn’t** affect the LTV rate banding and can be added on top of the maximum lend given for affordability.
  * **Legal fees:** these are paid to the solicitor for legal work done on behalf of the customer (i.e. transfer ownership of the property to them) and work undertaken on behalf of the lender (e.g. registering the mortgage deed). 
  * **Occupier's consent form fee:** this applies to other people living in the property age 17 or over (excluding dependants under 26). If the property is in England or Wales these people will need to sign a consent form and receive independent legal advice prior to completion, for which they are likely to be charged a fee. 
  * **Variable valuation fee:** this covers the cost of the valuation. See [Valuation Fees](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/property-and-valuations.html#valuations).
  * **CHAPS fee:** this is a charge for sending the mortgage funds to the customer's solicitor on completion.
  * **Early repayment charge:** this is payable if customer repays all or part of a mortgage during the deal period.
  * **Adding fees to the loan:** A product fee is the only fee that can be added to the loan. Adding this fee to the loan **doesn’t** affect the LTV rate banding and can be added on top of the maximum lend given for affordability.
    * Exception: Right to Buy- Legal fees can be added to the loan but only within the maximum LTV limits.
  * **Future fees:** once your customer’s mortgage is set up, they may need to pay one-off fees for other services. These include changing the date of direct debit collection, duplicate statements, adding or removing someone from their title deeds.

For more information, please review:

  * Other committed expenditure.

Commitments with less than **6 months** left to run, can be excluded when checking the affordability calculator. Exclusions to this are: credit cards and car finance agreements (e.g. Hire Purchase, PCP).
Where the customer has stated that they no longer need a car and will look to return it, we will still factor this payment into affordability.

###  First-time Buyer 
  * Our definition of a First-time Buyer (FTB) is a customer who has not owned a property before.
  * First-time buyer exclusive products are only available on a capital and interest basis
  * If the mortgage application is made by more than one person, one of the applicants must meet this definition in order to qualify for any first-time buyer exclusive mortgage deals
  * A customer who has a buy to let property but is now seeking to purchase a residential property does not qualify. The customer is not buying for the first time as they have already bought a property.

For more information, pleasee see our [first-time buyer hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/first-time-buyers.html).

###  Foreign currency income 
We will use 100% of converted income and will not apply a haircut. For any foreign currency values other than GBP, the amount should be converted using an appropriate currency conversion tool and input as GBP in the application and will be subject to the exchange rate on the day of underwriter assessment. Please see below for our acceptable list of currencies:

Where all or part of an applicant's income used to make the mortgage repayments is paid to them in a foreign currency, the MCD requires advisers to provide additional point of sale risk disclosures. It also requires lenders to monitor the customer’s foreign exchange exposure and notify them when it deviates adversely by 20% or more from the exchange rate at the point that the mortgage was completed.
Please also see [Working abroad](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/lending-criteria.html?intcam=HP-B-TB-DEF-Default#VW).

Foster Carers should provide Local Authority confirmation of the last two years’ payments received, along with confirmation that the customer is still a registered Foster Carer from the Local Authority.

Probate will allow an estate to be distributed to the relevant beneficiaries by the appointed representatives.
Please submit the application as:
  * A **purchase** application where the property **has not** yet been transferred into the beneficiary’s name (but will be following completion of the mortgage) meaning Land Registry will not have been updated to show the beneficiary as the legal owner. We can treat the equity that is to be inherited as the clients own deposit in the same way we do for concessionary purchases. Please see 'gifted equity/concessionary purchase', under [Proof of deposit](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/income-and-packaging.html#deposit).

### Lending Criteria L 

###  Leasehold 
Where the remaining leasehold term is less than 85 years, the value of the property will continue to reduce until the lease is extended. This may result in the valuation being less than the purchase price or estimated value. This could also result in the property being declined. 
In all instances, assessment will be made based on the valuer's comments. We require a minimum of 30 years to be remaining on the lease at the end of the mortgage term. However, some flexibility is allowed for properties in prime locations in central London, where the minimum lease left at the end of the mortgage should be 10 years. 

###  Lending into retirement- Buy to Let 
**First Time buyer/Non-owner occupier:**
Maximum lending to age 80 or the customers intended retirement age where this is sooner. We don’t lend into retirement or where the customer is already retired.
**Small Landlord/Portfolio Landlord:**
Maximum lending to age 80 irrespective of retirement age.
For more information, please consult our [Buy to Let Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/btl-hub.html?intcam=).

###  Lending into retirement- residential 
We are not able to accept residential lending into retirement applications.
Where a customer is already retired and in receipt of retirement income we can consider these applications as long as they meet our [Age Requirements](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/lending-criteria.html#A).
We are investigating a solution that would allow a customer whose existing term takes them into retirement to port like for like via a broker channel in the future. Currently, where the customer is looking to do this and their existing term goes into retirement, they should contact us [directly](https://www.natwest.com/mortgages.html).
_Additional borrowing_
We will not allow customers to take any additional borrowing where the term for the new borrowing extends into retirement. They may still apply for new borrowing if their existing mortgage extends into retirement but there must be more than 10 years until the customer(s) intended retirement date and the customer(s) pension contributions will be reviewed as part of our affordability assessment.
All the above requirements apply to both employed and self-employed applicants.

###  Lending Limits - Loan amounts and LTVs 

Please see our [Porting Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/porting.html#amounts) for further information.

These applications can be considered, for more information on our Buy to Let criteria, please consult our [Buy to Let Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/btl-hub.html?intcam=).
**_Residential Application – Purchasing the new property_**
Where the predicted rental income on the property to be let covers the expected mortgage payment, this can be disregarded from the affordability calculation.
We require a letter from a local ARLA-registered letting agent or estate agent to show the expected rental income.
If there is a shortfall then this must be disclosed as a monthly commitment.
Where we are doing the let to buy application **and** the new purchase application, the combined average Loan to Value (LTV) must be **90% or less**. This is our standard policy however is subject to underwriters’ discretion.

###  Loan to Income (residential new business only) 
The tables below show our highest and lowest loan-to-income (LTI) ratios according to repayment type, income and loan to value.

Please note that these ratios are caps - actual maximum loan amounts are subject to wider affordability checks and are dependent on your client's credit score.
Our affordability calculator can give a good indication of the amount we would be willing to lend. However, the calculator doesn’t conduct a credit search and as such the indicative lend is potentially subject to change when the agreement in principle is submitted.
For Product transfer with additional borrowing affordability, please check our [Additional Borrowing Affordability Calculator](https://spa.mortgages.natwest.com/calculator/adbo-affordability "https://spa.mortgages.natwest.com/calculator/adbo-affordability")
For Buy to Let affordability see our [Buy to Let Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/btl-hub.html "https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/btl-hub.html")

###  Lodgers 
A customer can have a lodger living in the property at the same time as they occupy it, providing there is no formal tenancy agreement in place.
If the customer is not living in the property and they have a tenancy agreement in place, the customer would either need to obtain Consent to Let or switch to a Buy to Let.
We have no set restriction on how many lodgers a customer has in the property at any one time, as long as the property won’t be classed as a [House In Multiple Occupation](https://www.gov.uk/private-renting/houses-in-multiple-occupation) or breach our [Residential Business Use guidance](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/property-and-valuations.html).
There is no consent required for a customer to have a lodger living with them, however an occupiers waiver will need to be signed where the lodger is or will be living in the property upon completion of the mortgage.

###  Long Term Town Allowance 
  * A variation of allowances can be received by customers to compensate for the location of their work e.g. Town Allowance, High Cost Area Allowance, Area Allowance etc
  * Consideration should be given to whether the customer is relocating as part of the application, and whether the income will continue

This should be evidenced in line with Long Term Large Town allowance requirements on the [Income and Packaging Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/income-and-packaging.html).

### Lending Criteria M 

###  Maintenance 
**Child maintenance:**
Child maintenance can be accepted at 100%. This can either be court ordered or non-court ordered.
**Court Approved Maintenance (spousal):**
Can be accepted at 100%. This will be subject to underwriting and we may require sight of the court order.
• There is an expectation the payments will continue at the current level for at least the next 5 years and we may also need to understand how the customer will replace this income when it ends.
• We require up to 3 months bank statements to evidence this, please see your tailored packaging requirements upon submission of the Full Mortgage Application.
• The party paying the maintenance can’t be named on the bank account the maintenance is paid into.
• We can consider maintenance income paid by someone living abroad subject to the underwriters discretion, upon a Full Mortgage Application being submitted. This must be paid in an acceptable [currency](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/lending-criteria.html#F). 

###  Maximum LTV 
See '[Lending limits & Max LTV's](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/lending-criteria.html#L)'.

###  Mortgage Credit Directive 
The European Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD) came into force on 21st March 2016. It aims to harmonise mortgage markets across the European Economic Area, ensuring that mortgage firms act fairly and professionally and that their staff have an appropriate level of knowledge and competence for advising, manufacturing and servicing mortgages. The key issues that lenders and brokers had to incorporate into their businesses were:
  * The Key Facts Illustration (KFI) was replaced by the new European Standard Information Sheet (ESIS), which incorporates a new Annual Percentage Rate of Charge (APRC) and second APRC.
  * A new approach to monitoring customers’ foreign exchange exposure, including where part or all of their income is in a currency other than sterling.
  * A new classification of consumer buy-to-let mortgages.
  * A new 7-day reflection period.
  * Greater transparency over declined applications.
  * Regulation of second charge lending.

European Standard Information Sheet (ESIS): the MCD replaced the old sale and offer Key Facts Illustration (KFI) documentation with a new European Standard Information Sheet (ESIS) template, called a Mortgage Illustration in the UK. This document includes some additional disclosures for customers to ensure they fully understand their mortgage product and the risks of future interest rate increases. Transitional arrangements are in place to enable lenders to use a KFI 'top-up' approach before moving to the new Mortgage Illustration no later than March 2019. We have implemented the use of the new Mortgage Illustration without the transitional step of using the KFI 'top-up'.
7-day reflection period: the MCD introduced a new 7-day reflection period to ensure borrowers have sufficient time to duly consider the various offers they receive. Therefore, when a mortgage offer is made to a customer, there is a 7-day reflection period where the customer’s offer will remain valid for them to accept. At any point during this period the customer can accept the offer, and likewise reject it, or allow the offer to lapse.
We already give our customers longer than 7 days for them to consider offers they receive, so this will not have any impact on our current processes. If a customer wishes to complete the mortgage at any point during the 7-day reflection period they can waive the period by accepting the offer. We will still retain our right to review our decision to lend should new information be provided that changes a customer's eligibility.
Mortgage application declines: the MCD required greater transparency when a mortgage application is declined by a lender. If a customer has their application declined, they need to be told of this decision in a timely manner. Furthermore, if the decline is as a result of information held about the customer by a credit reference agency, the applicant must be informed of the particular agency used.
We utilise multiple credit reference agencies. Where a customer’s application is being arranged by an intermediary and is declined, it is the responsibility of the intermediary to inform the customer of the credit reference agency used if this is the reason for the decline.
Regulation of second charge mortgages: the MCD required that second charge lending becomes subject to FCA mortgage rules. Lenders’ and intermediaries’ existing mortgage permissions enable them to operate in the second charge lending sector and the FCA contacted them in the first quarter of 2016 to find out if they intend to do so. We do not currently operate in the second charge lending sector and have no intentions to do so.

###  Mortgage Charter 
The UK Government has announced new support for borrowers who are struggling with their mortgage payments. We're committed to helping our customers through this difficult time and we're pleased to be a part of this Mortgage Charter to help ease the pressure for our customers.
Should your customer wish to explore their option or find out more they can visit our [Mortgage cost of living support page](https://www.natwest.com/mortgages/existing-customers/mortgage-cost-of-living-support.html).

###  Mortgage Guarantee Scheme 
As of 22nd December 2022 we have withdrawn from the Mortgage Guarantee Scheme.
We continue to support 95% LTV mortgages for loans up to £570,000. Please see our [Product Guide](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/products.html) for further information. 

###  Mortgage Payment (Interest) 
We will charge interest monthly in arrears from the day on which we release the Loan to you or the conveyancer.
Interest on your mortgage is calculated daily on the outstanding balance and applied to your account monthly on the anniversary of completion. This is called the charging period.
  * If there isn’t 14 days between the date you complete your mortgage and your chosen payment date, we won’t take your first payment until the following month.

For example, if you complete your mortgage on 15th January and your chosen payment date is 20th, your first monthly payment will be claimed on 20th February.
The first months interest will be added to your account on 15th February to cover the period 15th January to 14th February.
If your chosen payment date differs to the anniversary of completion date, there will be an interest balance that remains outstanding for the first month. This will remain on your mortgage balance until it’s paid, meaning you will pay more over the term of your mortgage.

###  Mortgage Prisoners 
Mortgage Prisoners are a group of customers identified by the FCA, who, following a Mortgage Market Review, have been unable to switch to a better mortgage deal with their existing lender or to a new lender.
We are unable to accept applications from brokers who are not registered and approved by the FCA for Mortgage Prisoner cases. We can’t consider Buy to Let applications under Mortgage Prisoner policy. 
We contacted all the Mortgage Prisoner FCA approved firms at the point that the FCA launched the Mortgage Prisoner initiative, with guidance on how to submit this type of application to us. Should your firm not have received this guidance or have only recently been approved to provide these mortgages, first please check that your firm is named in the FCA approved list [here](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/homes/buying-a-home/help-for-mortgage-prisoners) (at the bottom of the page under “Speak to a mortgage broker”). Once your firm’s name appears on the FCA approved list, contact our BDA team who will be able to provide you with the guidance.
Mortgage Prisoner customers should be referred to their current mortgage provider for more details on their options. 
Please see our [Mortgage Prisoners Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/mtg-pris-hub.html).

###  Overpayments 
Customers can overpay up to an annual limit of 20% before incurring an ERC. Please see [Early Repayment Charges](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/lending-criteria.html#E) for more information.
Should your customer wish to arrange an overpayment, please ask them visit [Manage Your Mortgage](https://www.natwest.com/mortgages/existing-customers.html) or call: 0345 302 0190.
They can choose to set up regular overpayments or make one off lump sum payments.
For regular overpayments:
  * We must receive your customers overpayment request at least 14 days prior to their next payment day in order for this to be processed in time for that payment, otherwise the change will take effect from their following payment date.
  * Regular overpayment amounts will be collected with your customers monthly payment and will not be varied automatically as a result of any change to the interest rate. The agreed overpayment will continue to be collected with the revised monthly payment after any such change.

Once an overpayment is made, the amount your customer owes is reduced immediately meaning they will be paying less interest on the outstanding balance straight away.
Our [Mortgage overpayment calculator](https://www.natwest.com/mortgages/mortgage-calculators/mortgage-overpayment-tool.html) can help the customer understand the effect an overpayment can have on their monthly payments and/or pay off the mortgage earlier. 

###  Overtime 
We can consider 100% of regular overtime evidenced by the last 3 months consecutive payslips. Monthly income should correlate to YTD salary.
Where this is paid weekly the latest 13 payslips will be required.

###  Ownership 
  * We allow Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor. Please see our [Family-Backed Mortgage hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/family-backed-mortgage.html) for more detail.

###  Pension Contributions 
For affordability, you'll need to include the amount that your client (s) will pay that they would class as essential (non-discretionary) following completion/drawdown of their mortgage application as a pension commitment.
This could be more or less than what they currently pay, based on what the customer/s confirm their contribution will be following completion/drawdown. Please enter the gross amount, our calculators will factor in any tax relief.
Pension provisions do not include:
  * Ad-hoc contributions, only regular contributions made via employers or into a personal pension.

[Northern Ireland](https://www.justice-ni.gov.uk/articles/information-enduring-powers-attorney-epa)
[Scotland](https://www.mygov.scot/power-of-attorney)
We may be able to consider mortgage applications made by an Attorney but this will depend on the type of POA in place and is always subject to our lending criteria.
We will require a copy of the Power of Attorney document and we will need to carry out identification and verifications checks on all Attorneys applying on behalf of someone else.
_**Guardianship, Controller and Deputyship**_
Where an application is made by a Guardian under a Guardianship Order (Scotland), a Controller under a Controller Order (Northern Ireland), a Deputy under a Deputyship Order or in line with an Order by the Court of Protection (England and Wales) we can consider these on a case by case basis.
We will require copies of all relevant court papers and we will need to carry out identification and verifications on all individuals appointed to deal with another person’s financial affairs.

### Lending Criteria R

We do not currently support regulated Buy to Let.

###  Repayment methods 
The following methods are acceptable:
  * Capital and Interest (C&I).
  * Interest Only (IO).
  * Mixed repayment method (part and part).

###  Right to Buy 
We support customers who want to purchase their own home under the ‘Right to Buy’ or ‘Rent to Mortgage’ schemes in **England and Northern Ireland**.
  * ‘Right to Acquire’ is the term used by Housing Associations and is also acceptable.
  * The names on the Right to Buy letter should always match the application.
  * All mortgages must be on a Capital and Interest Repayment.
  * For right to buy properties, we will lend 100% of the discounted purchase price subject to a maximum of 90% of the open market value (subject to LTV max of current product range).
  * Further advances are only permitted for home improvements during the discount period.
  * Applicants can raise additional funds for home improvements, the amount they can raise is determined by the discount period given by the council. For example, if a property is worth £100,000, and the customer has been offered to purchase this property for £60,000, we will allow them to borrow £60,000 plus some additional money for home improvements. On a 5 year scheme this will be 1/5th of the £40,000 discount and on a 3 year scheme this will be 1/3rd of the £40,000 discount given. This is subject to credit score and affordability.

### Lending Criteria S 

###  Seafarers 
We can consider Seafarers income if this is paid in an acceptable currency to NatWest and can be evidenced via payslips and, where tax is not paid at source, the most recent SA302 to confirm that the client is registered for UK tax.
The client must also have permanent right to reside in the UK, have settled or pre-settled status or Irish Citizenship AND must live in the UK when not at sea.
The evidence requirements will depend on the customer's employment type. Please see our [Income and Packaging Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/income-and-packaging.html).

###  Search Indemnity Insurance 
We allow search indemnity insurance arranged by a clients solicitor for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, providing the search insurance adequately protects us and the solicitor is able to certify that the title is good and marketable.
The search indemnity policy will cover local authority searches rather than Land Registry searches. We would still expect solicitors to carry out Land Registry searches (this can be done online for £3).
We will accept personal searches, provided that the search agent has the adequate professional indemnity insurance and the solicitor can still give a clear Certificate of Title.

###  Second Charges 
We can consider cases where the property has a 2nd charge, subject to a Deed of Postponement (DoP), to ensure we hold 1st legal charge.
In this instance the customer would be required to pay a registration fee for the DoP to Land Registry.
Before we issue the offer, we must receive consent from the customer to reach out to the 2nd charge lender to proceed with the DoP. The 2nd charge holder will need to consent that our charge will have priority over their charge. The documents need to be signed and posted to us.
Any fees charged by the second charge holder will be met by the customer.
In a case where a second charge is being redeemed before completion, a future dated redemption statement needs to be submitted for us to issue the offer.

###  Second Jobs 
We can use up to 100% of second job income.
We require a minimum of 6 months employment to utilise the income from a 2nd job. We will require a longer track record where the second job is not a permanent PAYE contract. Please refer to our [Income and Packaging Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/income-and-packaging.html).
We can consider income from more than 2 jobs and would need to understand the overall sustainability of the income ie: amount of hours worked each week. 

###  Second Residential Property 
We can consider 2nd residential properties up to 95% LTV.
Where both residential mortgages will be held with NatWest, the average LTV should be no more than 90%.
  * In all scenarios the mortgage payment of their existing or background property must be included as a commitment. We cannot offset this by any rent the customer may receive.
  * Any other property related costs will need factored in too such as utilities, council tax, ground rent or service charge as relevant.
  * Where a relative (e.g. Parents) occupy the property and pay the utilities and council tax, please detail this on the application and we will look to exclude this from affordability.
  * We can’t lend on a 2nd residential property where it will be let on a formal tenancy agreement.

###  Self-Build 
The bank considers a property to be a Self-Build where; 
  * It meets our [New Build definition](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/new-build-hub.html#definition "https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/new-build-hub.html#definition"), decided by the valuer at point of valuation and; 
  * Where there is no purchase transaction involved   

In England, Wales and Scotland, we **can’t** consider any requests to repay self-build lending a customer has taken with another lender or lend on a ‘self-build’ property built/owned by a customer within the last 2 years. We also do not lend on incomplete self-builds. 
We can consider self-build properties in Northern Ireland where the current mortgage is with Ulster Bank. See our [Northern Ireland Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/northern-ireland-hub.html "https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/northern-ireland-hub.html") for more information.

Where the solar panels are leased the solicitor will review the [UK lenders Handbook](https://lendershandbook.ukfinance.org.uk/lenders-handbook/solar-panels-and-the-lenders-handbook/).
Solar panels need to be installed by an MCS contractor where they are bought outright or leased.

For more information, please see our [Self-employed Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/self-employed-hub.html).

###  Solicitors' fees 
We have a panel of solicitors for our fees assisted remortgage service. There is no charge to the customer for standard legal costs on a remortgage loan below £2 million, where a fee’s assisted product is selected. 
All of our panel commit to charging the same scale of fees for any additional services which a customer may require. Please refer to our list of these fees for[ England & Wales](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/content/dam/natwest_com/Intermediary/PDFs/2025-04-16SolicitorFeesEandWSRV01.01.pdf) and [Scotland](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/content/dam/natwest_com/Intermediary/PDFs/2024-01-24SolicitorFeesScotlandSRV01.01.pdf).
Below is list of exclusions where the fees assisted solicitors can’t be used:   

· Where documentation will be signed by an attorney acting on behalf of the customer under a Power of Attorney. 
· Shared ownership cases where the final share in a shared ownership property is to be purchased and title to the property is passing to the Customer. 
· Properties which are tenanted at the time of the re-mortgage (other than to Buy to Let re-mortgages). 
· Cases where there is a material defect in or issue with the title which in the Fees Assisted Conveyancer’s view requires the customer to instruct their own solicitor (this includes circumstances which require the title to be -split). 
· Where the amount of the mortgage exceeds two million pounds (£2,000,000). 
· Transfers of equity in connection with matrimonial proceedings, separation or where the parties to the transfer are in dispute. The Fees Assisted Conveyancer’s can deal with the re-mortgage transaction and the transfer of title only (giving no legal or financial advice). Any legal or financial advice must be given by the customer’s solicitor 
If the appointed fee’s assisted legal solicitors confirm they are unable to act following instruction from us, the customer will need to instruct their own solicitors at their own cost. 
To see our fees assisted rates on our [Product Page,](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/products.html#NewBusiness) look for the rates which show as ‘yes’ under the ‘free legal’ section on the rate guide.

###  Shift Allowance 
A variation of allowances can be received by customers to compensate for additional responsibilities / working hours.
Common examples may include but not limited to:
• Additional Duty Hours.
• Call Out.
• Danger Allowance.
• Offshore Allowance.
• On Call.
• Sleepover Allowance.
• Standby.
• Unsocial Hours.
• WTD (Working Time Directive).
Working from Home Allowance is not Acceptable.
This should be evidenced in line with Shift Allowance requirements in the [Income and Packaging Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/income-and-packaging.html).

###  Standard Variable Rate 
A standard variable rate (SVR) is a type of variable-rate mortgage. The SVR is a lender's default rate without any limited-term deals or discounts attached. A lender can raise or lower its SVR at any time. Standard variable rates tend to be influenced by changes in the level of the Bank of England's base rate. However, a lender may also decide to change its SVR while the base rate remains unchanged.
Please refer to our [product range](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/products.html) for our current SVR. 

###  Stipend 
We can consider stipend income where the long term nature of the income can be evidenced.
Stipends are commonly paid to clients who are studying their PhD, are in a religious role or working for a university or a scholarship. This is not an exhaustive list and others can be considered.
Please [contact our BDA’s](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/contact-us.html) to discuss this further. 

###  Student Loans 
The customer’s income will determine whether they need to make Student Loan repayments. They need be included as a financial commitment where the applicant is already making repayments.
When declaring the student loan commitment on the application, you need to consider:
  * Income increases- If the customers income has recently increased and will continue at the higher level e.g. due to a pay rise, the higher student loan deduction needs to be used.
  * Fluctuating income- If the customers income fluctuates meaning their student loan repayment changes, please average the payments over the last 3 months payslips.

**Example:**
If the student loan deduction is £50 in June, £80 in July and £80 in August, add all three amounts and divide by three.
  * £50 + £80 + £80 = £210 / 3 = £70

However, if the customer's income has increased and £80 will be the ongoing payment, this should be used instead.

### Lending Criteria T/U

For more information on income we can support with or are unable to accept please see our [Income and Packaging Hub](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/income-and-packaging.html).

###  Universal Credit 
Universal Credit may comprise of:
  * Standard Allowance - This can only be included where it can be evidenced from the award statement that the customer is employed/self-employed i.e. the statement details the take-home pay. This will confirm that the customer is in receipt of [Working Tax Credits](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/lending-criteria.html#VW) and employment support allowance and not unemployment benefits. If the take-home pay shows as £0 on the statement, the standard allowance can't be used for mortgage purposes.
  * Children - This is treated the same as [Child Benefit and Child Tax Credits](https://www.intermediary.natwest.com/intermediary-solutions/lending-criteria.html?intcam=#C). 
  * Housing - This should be deducted from the monthly payment figure and **not** included for mortgage affordability purposes.

The customer must provide their Universal Credit statement(s). This must include a full breakdown of this income. Circumstances are assessed each month meaning the amount paid may change.
Please note the customer(s) named on the award statement must match the application.
