Non standard constructions
We have no LTV restrictions, as long as the property is mortgageable and suitable to the area

Full UK coverage
We lend to borrowers in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland


Low property values
Our minimum property value is £75,000

This target market assessment matrix, segments the target customers for the Product, recognising their different needs to enable you to tailor the services you provide when you distribute the Product.

Customer Circumstances:
Customers with an imperfect credit profile that may have been declined by High street lenders.

Distribution Strategy:
- Available through Direct and Intermediary channels
- Intermediary distribution via:
  * Directly Authorised Brokers/Intermediaries
  * Networks
  * Mortgage Clubs
- All Intermediaries must be accredited with Central Trust Limited
- All applications on a fully advised basis only

Customer Needs & Objectives:
- Access to finance that is not based on their credit score
- Looking to repair their credit file to enable them to have the ability to borrow from a High street lender in the future
- Consolidation of other secured and unsecured credit into a more manageable monthly payment, reducing their monthly outlay
- Wide range of Loan size available - required loan size may not be available via an unsecured product
- Longer term required than unsecured products may allow

The Product is NOT designed for customers who:

4. CUSTOMERS WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF VULNERABILITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Product is designed for customers who have a need for finance which will be secured on their home, this may include customers with characteristics of vulnerability or those who may experience vulnerability at some point during the lifetime of their mortgage.

CTL is mindful of the FCA's four key drivers of vulnerability, being:
- Health
- Life Events
- Resilience
- Capability

CTL uses these to help identify customers who may show one or more of these characteristics.

Customer vulnerability can be permanent or temporary and cover a wide range of challenging personal circumstances. These customers are especially susceptible to harm, and may require additional help and support in managing their mortgage. Customers with certain disabilities may have reasonable adjustments made and experience a different process, but will not receive a different outcome to others within the target market.

We are continually developing our framework to achieve good outcomes for vulnerable customers, which includes:
- Education and training for our staff to ensure they have the appropriate skills and knowledge to recognise and respond to the needs of vulnerable customers
- Dedicated collections specialists that work collaboratively with vulnerable customers
- Suitable customer service provision and communications
- Credit risk policies designed to assess existing financial circumstances at the point of application and ensure that lending is affordable for the applicant
- Monitoring to ensure we continue to meet and respond to the needs of customers with characteristics of vulnerability

Intermediaries should continue to comply with their obligations to ensure that they treat customers in vulnerable circumstances fairly.

Please contact us if you need any further information about how we support the needs of all our customers in relation to the Product.
