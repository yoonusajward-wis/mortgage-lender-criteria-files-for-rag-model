- Where the stated expenditure does not reflect that shown on the bank statements or appears otherwise unrealistic you will be asked to submit revised expenditure details.

You are strongly recommended to thoroughly verify the stated expenditure as delays may occur or the case may be declined where the information provided is deemed inaccurate.

- However, where the term exceeds either of the borrowers expected retirement age or 70 years, whichever is the soonest, evidence of retirement income must be provided. Affordability will be based on the retirement income alone
- If your client is already retired the maximum LTV we can consider is 70%.
- If the mortgage term takes the applicant(s) into retirement then the maximum LTV we can consider is 80%.
- This is based on the oldest applicant's age on their next birthday.

BUY TO LET DEFINITIONS GUIDE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Unregulated BTL** - a property bought with the intention to let under an AST. AST must be between the tenant and landlord (applicant) and a minimum of 6 months, maximum 12 months.

**Regulated (family) BTL** - a property let to a close family member – parent, grandparent, sibling, grandchild, child – other family members such as cousins etc do not qualify and in these cases we would class as an 'unregulated' BTL. No rental income, even if paid, will be factored in to our affordability assessment.

PORTFOLIO LANDLORDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What is a portfolio landlord?**
A portfolio landlord is defined as someone with 4 or more Buy-to-Let properties, irrespective of which lender(s) the properties are mortgaged with. It is the 4th and further properties that will be assessed using our updated criteria.

**Why are they assessed differently?**
As a lender, we recognise that, in an economic downturn, the impact on someone with multiple properties could be greater than someone with a single property. Hence we assess across the full portfolio rather than the property the mortgage is being applied for. Although at Furness we have had portfolio landlord criteria in place for several years, in Sept 2017 the Prudential Regulation Authority introduced industry-wide guidelines for lenders and as a result, we have made further updates to our criteria.

**Are the products and pricing different?**
Portfolio landlords can apply for any of our standard Buy-to-Let products which are available up to 75% LTV. There is a maximum of 4 Holiday-Let properties (with a Furness Building Society Mortgage) in each portfolio.

**Do I have to submit additional forms and information?**
As well as providing scanned copies of documents such as tenancy agreements, all applicants will also need to complete an Assets and Liabilities statement, which you can find on our forms and resources page.

**What are your portfolio landlord specific criteria?**

| Criteria | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Maximum LTV per property | 75% LTV |
| Maximum LTV across a portfolio | 65% LTV |
| Minimum rental coverage across a portfolio | 140% of mortgage interest at pay rate |
| BTL experience required | 2 years experience as a BTL Landlord |
| Minimum income | £40,000 (excluding rental income) |
| Maximum BTL lending with the society | £750,000 and/or 5 mortgages |
| Maximum overall customer BTL borrowing | £2m mortgages/10 mortgaged properties |
| Application requirements | Normal disclosure of personal financial circumstances and completion of an Assets and Liabilities Statement. In some cases we may also request a business plan and cashflow statement to be provided |

REGULATED BUY-TO-LET
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- We will consider applications on a regulated Buy-to-Let product specifically for letting to family members.
- We will not currently consider applications from adult children (sons and/or daughters) purchasing their parents' current residence and then renting it back.
- Regulated Buy-to-Let applications are considered strictly on an affordability basis. Any rental income received will not be factored into our affordability assessment. We obtain the AST to ensure that if the property converted to a traditional buy to let the gross rent would be at least equal to 125% of the monthly interest payment at the initial pay rate).
- Regulated Buy-to-Let applications are assessed in the same way as a standard residential mortgage. The Society stresses the mortgage repayment in order to assess the affordability of the loan in relation to the clients existing outgoings and factoring in the new Buy-to-Let.
- The stated expenditure will be reviewed in conjunction with the bank statements and/or with statistical data, as appropriate. Applications will be declined where affordability cannot be proven on realistic expenditure.
- The Society will consider applications on an Interest only or repayment basis.
- Where the property is let to a family member without an AST the tenant(s) will be required to sign the age 17+ waiver form
