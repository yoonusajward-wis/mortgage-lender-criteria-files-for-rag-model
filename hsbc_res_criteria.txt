### Portfolio landlords
### Rental income

Please note: Where rental income is not being used to support the affordability assessment of a residential mortgage, there is no requirement to obtain evidence of any BTL income that the customer may have.

However, all associated costs of the BTLs must be included in the affordability assessment.

Our policy for lending to customers with Buy to Let (BTL) properties and definition of a Portfolio Landlord is as follows:

### A Portfolio landlord is a person(s) with:

Four or more Buy to let UK mortgaged properties in aggregate at the end of the transaction (e.g. acceptable if the customer currently has three or fewer Buy to Let UK mortgaged properties).

Note: the number of existing BTL mortgaged properties should include any additional BTL properties which are in the process of being mortgaged with ourselves.

*Please note, for joint applications the 'aggregate' would be the combined number of BTL's held by both applicants on the mortgage.

This includes income via a holding company.

## Borrowing

### Additional borrowing / Capital raising

#### Application types:

* Standalone Additional Borrowing (Home Owner Loan) - where an existing HSBC mortgage customer is borrowing additional funds
* Remortgage my existing mortgage with Additional Borrowing - where an applicant is transferring their borrowing from another mortgage provider to HSBC and is borrowing additional funds
* Remortgage my unencumbered property - where an applicant is borrowing money against a property they own outright, which has no existing mortgage or other charge over the property

Please refer to the Term section for details on the maximum term for Additional borrowing / Capital raising applications.

We offer additional borrowing for a variety of reasons such as home improvements, debt consolidation and other lifestyle reasons. We cannot lend where the funds are to be used for investments or speculative purposes.

Where the customer is looking to raise funds for an onward purchase such as a second residential property or Buy to let, the new mortgage payment must also be included as a cost in the affordability assessment and evidenced with an ESIS / Mortgage offer.

Home improvements are defined as improvements to a habitable property. For a property to be confirmed as habitable you must be able to reside there, and it must have a functional kitchen, bathroom and toilet.

Where an application is for additional borrowing for Home Improvements to kitchens or bathrooms it can be considered habitable where these fittings are being replaced as part of the home improvements, as long as the other areas of the building remain fully habitable. In all cases a property must remain wind and watertight, secure, and fully covered by building insurance under normal terms.

Renovation of properties cannot be financed by way of a residential mortgage (except in extenuating circumstances for existing HSBC UK mortgage customers where this would be in the interests of the customer and the Bank, such as flood or fire damage. Please contact your BDM or our helpdesk for further information. [https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/broker-support/])

#### Additional Borrowing Eligibility

**Minimum loan amount of £10,000**

Please note, for homeowner loans/further advances linked to a Remortgage from another lender the minimum combined total lending amount must be no less than £10,000. The minimum for each loan part must be at least £1,000.

The maximum LTV for additional borrowing is 90%.

If you intend to capitalise a booking fee, this can exceed the LTV restrictions of the selected product and policy (in circumstances where only adding the fee has caused the LTV breach). Please be aware that a booking fee cannot be capitalised where adding the fee will breach a 95% LTV policy limit.

The above maximum LTV also only applies where the total loan size is not exceeded.

Please refer to the Loan section for further information on LTV limits.

Additional borrowing requests are subject to maximum term restrictions. Please see the term section for more information.

For information on further advances for debt consolidation please see the debt consolidation section. Please note that repayment of a second charge loan secured against the property is considered debt consolidation.

The property to be mortgaged; provides suitable security, is located in the UK, is and will remain habitable at all times during the term of the mortgage including during any alterations or improvements.

Named applicants must match the property owners

**Before applying for Additional Borrowing you will need to confirm the following:**

The applicant(s) is not applying for Additional Borrowing for any of the following purposes:

* For a land purchase where the land is adjacent to the property their mortgage is secured against, and is to benefit the mortgaged property
* To extend the leasehold on a flat or maisonette

#### Additional borrowing for existing HSBC UK mortgage customers

Please note, the Land Registry is currently experiencing delays in registering house purchases. This delay may impact HSBC UK mortgage customers looking to take out additional borrowing after six months of drawing down the original mortgage loan if the charge is not formally registered against the property.

In addition to the above eligibility

Your client must be on a Fixed Rate, Term Tracker, Lifetime Tracker or Standard Variable Rate

Your client will also need to be aware of the following exclusions which will result in their application not proceeding:

**Additional Borrowing Exclusions**

* To pay off a second charge on the property the mortgage is secured against
* For a land purchase where the land is adjacent to the property their mortgage is secured against, and is to benefit the mortgaged property
* To extend the leasehold on a flat or maisonette
* Any account in arrears
* More than five existing loan parts
* More than two applicants
* Debt consolidation exceeding £50,000. Please note that repayment of a second charge loan secured against the property is considered debt consolidation.
* If any existing lending has been drawn down within the last 6 months on the same secured property
* Shared Ownership/Right to Buy Loan or any other properties under special schemes
* Any account with consent to let
* Marital Disputes

When submitting an additional borrowing application, you have the option to select a date for the funds to be released. If no date is selected our general timescales are up to 10 business days from offer acceptance.

You will need to accept the offer document on the customer's behalf to ensure the application completes.

However, please note delays can occur due to unforeseen circumstances for example; Further investigations required into the main charge, Main charge not registered due to Land Registry delays or Direct Debit Bank Account checks. In some cases, we may need contact you to request further information.

**Further Information**

For the new borrowing amount, a procuration fee of 0.4% residential and 0.5% BTL will be paid for the new lending upon completion.

### Affordability

The affordability assessment reviews the customer's net income, the customer's committed expenditure, basic essential expenditure and the basic living costs of their household. Affordability is assessed on a capital repayment basis and takes into account likely future interest rate rises.

#### Evidencing customer expenditure

All customer stated credit and non-credit committed expenditure must be critically assessed.

Credit commitments are verified, bank statements may be required in some cases.

For international customers the last three months' worth of bank statements and the latest months credit card statement, where a credit card balance exists, must be provided.

For affordability you will need to include all credit card balances.

For any cards that are paid off in full each month, please include the highest balance during the last 1 month period as recently cleared balances may be included in our calculations.

Where evidence is provided to confirm a credit card balance has been repaid in full, for a minimum of the last 3 months and the latest balance is not higher than the preceding statement balances, this can be excluded from the affordability assessment.

#### Debts ending within 6 months

If an applicant can provide evidence that a commitment or ongoing cost is intended to cease within 6 months of their mortgage application, we will discount this debt from the debt/income calculation.

If further clarification is needed in respect of a customer's credit commitments, we reserve the right to examine Credit Bureau information to confirm the nature and true extent of their lending exposure.

### Buy to Lets in background

Our assessment is based on the full costs associated with the Buy to Let - not just the rental income, e.g. Landlord insurance, management fees, any anticipated costs during a void period such as council tax and utilities.

All rental income must be evidenced by the latest year's tax return.

Tenancy agreements and bank statements showing rental income, mortgage payments and outgoings related to the Buy to Let property are only acceptable as evidence in the following cases:

* The customer is paying tax related to their Buy to Let income via PAYE (this will need to be evidenced via a notice of coding and/or payslips); or
* Properties have been purchased within the current tax year; or
* The customer is not paying tax on the Buy to Let income due to their overall gross income level being less than their personal allowance

For customers with existing Buy to Let properties who are applying to purchase/remortgage a residential property for their own use, we will also need to ensure the request 'makes sense' and that the property being purchased or remortgaged is in line with the customer's profile.

### Childcare and school fees

Please complete the Parental leave form and upload to the application under 'Ad-hoc' for review by the underwriter. [https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/resources/]

We consider childcare and school fees as a regular outgoing and commitment, which will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Due to the Government changes announced on 30th October 2024, when completing a mortgage application where private school fees are applicable, you will be required to include all future costs including VAT.

### Lending into retirement

As part of our responsible lending policy the maximum age is dependent on the repayment type, and subject to meeting our Term & Lending into retirement criteria.

Where an applicant is within 10 years of age 70, or their anticipated retirement age if sooner,(subject to a system maximum), we will require current income documents and also pension projections (dated within the last 12 months).

The application will be assessed on affordability up to age 70, or anticipated retirement age if sooner, as well as affordability based on projected retirement income.

Where an applicant is over 10 years from age 70, or their anticipated retirement age if sooner, we will require current income documents.

The application will be assessed on affordability up to age 70, or anticipated retirement age if sooner. In this scenario, if the applicant is also applying for a term that will take them beyond the age of 70, or their anticipated retirement age if sooner, we will also require documents to evidence pension contributions (this can be either via a payslip or a pension statement).

#### Interest Only (including split repayment types)

If any part of the lending is Interest Only, the Interest Only policy will be applied to the whole application. The mortgage term must not exceed the oldest applicants 70th birthday or anticipated retirement age (whichever is sooner).

For more details, please see [Residential Interest Only Repayment Plans](https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/resources/).

#### Capital Repayment

Mortgage term must not exceed the oldest applicants 80th birthday.

**How we assess the application;**

Oldest applicant is within 10 years from their 70th Birthday or anticipated retirement age (whichever is sooner):

Lending on Capital Repayment that takes the oldest customer beyond their 70th birthday or anticipated retirement age (whichever is sooner) will only be considered if affordability can be evidenced to the oldest customers 70th Birthday or anticipated retirement age.

**Example:**

Oldest applicant is 63 years at the time of application.

Plans to retire at the age of 70.

They apply for a Capital repayment mortgage over a term of 10 years.

Affordability will be assessed, on current income, to age 70. Affordability will also be assessed on pension projections over the 10-year term.

This will be assessed on the lower of earned or pension income.

### Let to buy

We have enhanced our policy where the applicant is converting their existing property to a Buy to Let and completing the onward residential purchase with HSBC UK.

The onward residential purchase will no longer be capped at 80% LTV, nor subject to our Second property policy. We will need to evidence the conversion of the existing residential mortgage to a Buy to Let mortgage, with a Mortgage Offer from the lender.

The future rental income for the property being converted can also be utilised within the onward residential purchase application. Please note this does not apply to unencumbered properties.

Where the customer is converting their residential to a Let to Buy with another lender and the onward residential purchase is with HSBC UK, we require a letter from the Association of Rental Letting Agents (ARLA) to evidence the future expected rental income.

### Non-simultaneous sale and completion

This will be treated as running 2 properties. Our affordability calculations will consider both mortgage balances and running costs, plus the second property and income from employment (salary multiples) criteria will apply.

Please note, only simultaneous porting is available via HSBC UK for Intermediaries, where the existing HSBC mortgage must be repaid simultaneously with the drawdown of the new application.

### Transitional arrangements

Transitional Arrangements (TA) were introduced by the FCA in order to protect customers from becoming a 'mortgage prisoner' or 'trapped borrower' i.e. unable to move home or change their interest following the introduction of more stringent affordability requirements.

TA apply where there is a variation to a residential mortgage contract where no additional borrowing is being requested except for product fees that may have been added to the loan.

TA's only apply to existing residential HSBC UK mortgage customers. The TA policy cannot be applied to an external remortgage application, where your customer is seeking to transfer an existing mortgage from another lender without increasing their mortgage borrowing.

Under no circumstance should an application which meets TA criteria be declined or turned away without being formally assessed by an underwriter. This includes where the Decision in Principle offers less than the customers current mortgage. You will need to submit the application and all supporting documentation before the application can be considered.

Any customers who wish to complete a simultaneous porting application, who meet the TA criteria but are currently in arrears, will need to contact HSBC UK directly to complete these applications.

## Existing borrowers

### Consent to Let

If an existing HSBC customer wishes to temporarily let their property, please ask them to contact HSBC UK directly as they must obtain consent in accordance with the requirements of our legal charge.

| Members of the British Armed Forces, including Ghurkhas, who are on Active Service | All other applicants |
| --- | --- |

The customer cannot make any other changes to the terms of the mortgage or apply for additional borrowing during the Consent to let period.

This criteria only applies to a customer's main residential home of which they are planning to return to.

### Deceased Customers

**Product Switch** - If a joint mortgage where one of the parties has passed away, you are able to complete a product switch for the remaining customer who is the surviving borrower, while the mortgage is still in joint names.

Please ensure that the customer has already notified HSBC UK Mortgage Service Centre of their deceased partner.

**Additional Borrowing/any other changes** - If a joint mortgage where one of the parties has passed away please advise the surviving borrower to contact HSBC UK to discuss any future requirements, while the mortgage is still in joint names.

### Overpayments

Access our calculators to find out how a regular or lump sum overpayment could reduce the term and interest paid on the mortgage. [https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/calculators/]

Lump sum and overpayments can be made at any time to our lifetime tracker mortgages.

Our fixed rate and discount mortgages have an annual overpayment allowance equivalent to 10% of the principal mortgage balance at drawdown, or at the start of a new rate switch.

Overpayments can be made by lump sum reductions and/or additional ad-hoc payments credited direct to the mortgage.

The monthly payments will remain the same unless the customer asks us to recalculate them on their reduced mortgage balance.

Alternatively, the customer can set up a flexible overpayment arrangement.

If they choose this method, we will collect the overpayment in with the existing direct debit payment.

The arrangement can be set up for a specific period or until further notice, your customer will need to make sure the monthly overpayments will not exceed their annual allowance in any one period.

When the current rate changes, the customer will need to review the arrangement again as the standard monthly payments and allowance will be reset.

At the end of the flexible overpayment arrangement the standard monthly payments will automatically be reset.

This is the same if there is a change to the monthly payment date, rate or an amendment to the overpayment arrangement to a different amount.

The recalculation will take into account previous overpayments, as it is calculated on the principal mortgage balance, the current interest rate and the remaining mortgage term.

If a new flexible overpayment arrangement is put in place, or when the current overpayment arrangement ends, the bank will acknowledge this with a letter to the customers to confirm the new payments being collected.

The overpayment allowance is reset annually on the anniversary of the drawdown, or at the start of the new rate following a switch.

If your customer switches rates before this anniversary date, a new overpayment will commence from the date the new rate begins and will be calculated by using 10% of the mortgage balance at this time.

An overpayment allowance is not transferable to the next overpayment period, therefore any allowance not utilised will be forfeited.

The Early Repayment Charge (ERC) will only be applied to the mortgage if the customer was to exceed the overpayment allowance in any one annual period.

This applies to an overpayment made by lump sum payments, ad-hoc payments or on a monthly overpayment arrangement.

We cannot amend or set up the overpayment arrangement if the mortgage is in the billing cycle, this means 5 working days prior to the monthly mortgage payment being collected.

If you wish to cancel this arrangement, you will need to do so at least 7 working days before the payment is due.

By making overpayments, the customer will benefit from an interest saving immediately as interest is charged daily.

The term of the mortgage may be reduced which can result in the loan being repaid earlier.

This will only be achieved if overpayments are continually made throughout the original mortgage term.

If monthly payments are reset, they are calculated over the original mortgage term/remaining term.

Any projected savings as a result of overpayments are subject to change.

The projections are not guaranteed as they are based on the current interest rate, the overpayments against the existing monthly payments, and the remaining term.

All of these factors will change.

Any changes to the interest rate, payment date, or if the overpayment arrangement stops will result in the standard payments being recalculated over the original term.

We will revert to a standard monthly payment (minimum payment) following these changes.

If the annual overpayment allowance is set in a leap year, the allowance will not commence on drawdown or amendment, and will instead reset the following working day.

Online banking customers can view their overpayment allowance by using the overpayment screen on their mortgage account.

This shows the annual allowance amount, the start and end dates for the current period and the allowance balance remaining if overpayments have been paid.

## Fees

### Booking fee

A booking fee is charged on some of our mortgages to secure a particular mortgage rate or deal.

Customers have the option to add a booking fee to their loan instead of paying it in full upfront. Booking fees cannot be capitalised on an Interest Only Product Switch application, or where adding the fee will breach a 95% LTV policy limit for Residential applications or an 80% LTV policy limit for BTL applications.

If the customer chooses to add the booking fee to their loan, please make them aware they will pay more interest over the term of the loan than if they pay the booking fee in full at the outset.

When the booking fee is added to the loan it is then included in the total lending amount and overall LTV.

The total lending amount and resultant LTV are allowed to exceed the LTV restrictions of the selected product, and policy (in circumstances where only adding the fee has caused the LTV breach). Please note that the policy limit of 95% (for Residential applications) or 80% (for BTL applications) cannot be exceeded by capitalising a booking fee.

In all other circumstances the total lending amount and overall LTV must:

* Fit within the maximum affordability criteria
* Meet standard income multiple criteria.

Please refer to the Loan section for further information on LTV limits.

Please note, our booking fees are refundable if the application does not complete for any reason or if the customer chooses a new product before completion.

Any fees added to the loan will not be released to the customer.

### Completion fee

This fee is to cover the cost of electronically transferring the mortgage funds to the solicitor/licensed conveyancer or applicant(s).

**Exceptions to fee being charged:**

* Remortgage applications, where a Fees Assisted Legals only product is selected
* Where the mortgage funds are being transferred directly to an applicant(s) HSBC UK bank account (additional borrowing for existing HSBC UK mortgage customers and Remortgage my unencumbered property applications only)

The fee is deducted by direct debit from the same bank account as the first mortgage repayment. If this is an HSBC UK account, this will happen at the same time as the mortgage funds are transferred and non-HSBC UK accounts will be deducted approximately ten days afterwards.

The completion fee cannot be added to the mortgage.

### Early repayment charge

Applicants may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge if they repay the whole or part of their mortgage early (including, if they move to a different product or lender) during a certain period. Early Repayment Charges do not apply to tracker mortgages.

Although Early Repayment Charges apply to our fixed and discount rate mortgages, we provide customers with an annual overpayment allowance equivalent to 10% of the remaining mortgage balance. This means customers can choose to increase their monthly mortgage payments or make lump sum payments up to this allowance each year that Early Repayment Charges apply, without incurring any charges. The overpayment allowance is refreshed annually on the anniversary of the drawdown or the start of the new rate following a switch, and will be based on the current balance at the time. If the customer switches rates before this anniversary date, a new overpayment allowance will commence from the date the new rate begins.

If fixed or discount rate customers exceed their annual overpayment allowance for a given year, an Early Repayment Charge will be charged on the amount they have repaid over the allowance.

### Exit fee

HSBC does not currently charge borrowers any exit fee when they fully repay their mortgage.

### Fee Saver

Our Fee Saver deal means no booking fee and no standard valuation fee.

A completion fee is payable in all buyer and package types apart from Remortgage my existing mortgage applications via HSBC UK where a fees assisted Legals only product is selected.

We will cover the cost of one standard valuation where this is required by HSBC UK as part of the mortgage application.

Other fees and charges may be payable to other parties including, but not limited to legal fees and charges levied by an existing lender.

### Legal fees

These are the fees payable to the applicant's solicitor or licensed conveyancer acting on behalf of the applicant and/or HSBC. For details on the conveyancing options available to your customers, see the solicitors section.

### Valuations

HSBC UK only offer a Standard Valuation or a Scottish Transcript as part of our application process. If you require a more detailed type of valuation report (i.e. Homebuyers or Buildings Survey) you can source this independently using the services of an appropriately qualified surveyor, details of which can be found via the [RICS website](https://www.rics.org/).

We accept Foreign Currency loans through HSBC for Intermediaries. Intermediaries must make customers aware of the risks of potential exchange rate fluctuations and an illustration of the potential impact of 20% exchange rate fluctuation will be provided in the KFI+.

HSBC will notify the customer of the potential impact of an exchange rate fluctuation if there is an adverse fluctuation of more than 20%.

If the customer lives in a foreign country or is paid in foreign currency this needs to be captured.

For any foreign currency values other than GBP, the amount should be converted using an appropriate currency conversion tool and input as GBP in the application.

Foreign currency income is subject to a haircut within automated affordability calculations - the percentage haircuts are listed in the foreign currency matrix. Please be advised that any source of deposit funds must also have originated from an acceptable country of income. For a list of acceptable foreign currencies please view our [foreign currency matrix](https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/resources/).

### Income from self-employment

#### How we assess the application

We will accept self-employed incomes which include government Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS) grant income.

For information on maximum income multiples, please see the Loan to Income section.

Please note: Tax Calculations can be an online print out from HMRC website, an SA302 or the computation produced by the customer's accountant using commercial software and submitted to HMRC. [https://www.gov.uk/log-in-file-self-assessment-tax-return]

The latest HMRC documentation/accounts must be dated within the last 18 months.

Where a customer is self employed for multiple companies and these are not linked via a holding company, we would still need a view of all the accounts as there could be companies making a loss, impacting the customers overall income level/ sustainability of the income.

## Product

### Bridging Loans

HSBC UK does not currently provide bridging loans. For further information regarding lending to repay bridging loans please refer to our debt consolidation criteria.

### Concessionary purchase

We can lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the lower of the discounted purchase price or valuation. This ensures that customers are contributing to the purchase, rather than relying on any equity in the property to fund the deposit.

### Daily interest

The interest chargeable on the mortgage balance will be calculated every day rather than at the end of each week, month or year.

### Debt consolidation

A further advance for debt consolidation purposes is possible subject to customers meeting the following requirements:

* maximum of £50,000 and
* a maximum LTV of 80%, or 60% if there is any element of interest only borrowing.

Please note that all debt commitments will still be included in the affordability assessment, unless it can be proven that the commitment finishes in the next 6 months.

The following provides examples of common scenarios and gives guidance on whether they would be categorised by HSBC as debt consolidation (please note that this is not an exhaustive list):

| Debt Consolidation | Non Debt Consolidation |
| --- | --- |
| Monies borrowed from family and friends for the sole purpose of purchasing the property or to protect/improve our security and where there is an agreement in place for the repayment of the funds.<br><br>Please note: If the debt consolidation request exceeds £50,000 and your client is an existing HSBC customer, please discuss with your BDM before submission. | Monies borrowed from family and friends for the sole purpose of purchasing the property or to protect/improve our security and where the funds were originally a gift but the customer now chooses to repay them. |
| Repayment of funds obtained from the customer's business: Where the funds were obtained through a Directors loan or other agreement detailing terms of repayment and were for the sole purpose of purchasing the property or to protect/improve our security. | Repayment of funds obtained from the customer's business through their share of the net profit: Where the funds obtained were for the sole purpose of purchasing the property or to protect/improve our security and the customer wants to replenish the funds. These will be treated as a business investment and the HOL policy for business lending will need to be followed. |
| Repayment of a second charge loan against the security property<br><br>Repayment of a second /subsequent charge is only possible when the additional borrowing is linked to a remortgage. It is not available as a standalone Additional Borrowing application. | Transfer of security: Customer has first charge residential or Buy to Let mortgage lending secured against a property which was for the purpose of purchasing that property and wishes to transfer the lending to another property they own. |
| Repayment of contractual debt: Where a customer has a debt for which there is a contract in place stipulating the terms and conditions such as length of contract, terms of repayment etc. (For example credit card, personal loan, bridging loans, hire purchase agreement, PCP car agreement including repayment of the final or balloon payment). | Repayment of shared equity: Where a customer has taken a mortgage with another lender along with a Government Help to Buy Loan or other shared equity provider and now wishes to remortgage to HSBC with additional lending to fully repay the shared equity charge. These will be processed in line with our policy on purchase of a final share of a shared ownership property. |
| Repayment of savings: Where a customer has used their savings to purchase a property or for home improvements due to the timescales involved with the mortgage process and wishes to use secured lending to replenish their savings. | |

### Deposit

You need to confirm and document the source of an applicant's deposit as we will be unable to complete the mortgage without this information. Please do not forward any form of documentary evidence regarding deposits unless specifically requested.

**Foreign Nationals**

Deposit is funded from customer's own resources, i.e. personal savings. Gifts are not acceptable unless they are in addition to the 15 per cent deposit provided from the applicants own resources.

**Non-UK Residents**

Deposit is funded from customer's own resources, i.e. personal savings. Gifts are not acceptable unless they are in addition to the 25 per cent deposit provided from the applicants own resources.

**Source of deposit**

Please be advised that any source of deposit funds must also have originated from an acceptable country of income. For a list of acceptable foreign currencies please view our [foreign currency matrix](https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/resources/).

**Family discounted purchase**

Where the property is a discounted purchase from a family member, we will only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the lower of the 'discounted' purchase price or valuation. We will also rely on the solicitor or licensed conveyancer to satisfy themselves that the family member gifting the property is not insolvent, and to arrange suitable indemnity insurance for the full value of the property if they deem it necessary.

**Armed Forces concession**

Customers who are wanting to use Armed Forces Help to Buy Loan as a deposit for their mortgage will need to contact HSBC UK directly to complete these applications.

**Acceptable sources of deposit**

* **Personal savings**<br><br>Funded from the customer's own resources.
* **Secured borrowing**<br><br>Funds raised by releasing equity from another property owned by the applicant, this includes secure bridging loans
* **Gifted deposit from family member (including where protected by a Declaration of Trust)**<br><br>Where the deposit has been 'gifted' by a family member, the acting solicitor/conveyancer must obtain a signed letter from the donor to confirm the deposit is a 'non-refundable and an unconditional gift and that no interest is claimed in the property'.<br><br>Please note – a family member is considered to be close relation defined as a spouse, domestic partner, grandparent, parent, sibling, half sibling, aunt, uncle, cousin, in law relation or step relation.<br><br>If a family member is contributing towards the purchase price and wishes to protect their beneficial interest by way of a Declaration of Trust, we will need to approve this and ensure our interest in the property is protected. We will also require a Letter of Consent to be signed by the contributor.<br><br>Please note: We are unable to proceed if a Declaration of Trust is to be created against a property that will be registered to a sole proprietor (property owner)
* **Gifted deposit from occupier not named on mortgage**<br><br>Where the deposit has been 'gifted' by an occupier not named on the mortgage, the acting solicitor/conveyancer must obtain a signed letter from the donor to confirm the deposit is a 'non-refundable and an unconditional gift and that no interest is claimed in the property'. We cannot accept the gifted deposit if the occupier is not a family member.
* **Developer gifted deposit/Incentive**<br><br>Financial incentives provided by a Developer up to 5% of the property price are acceptable without impacting the property value. Where the value of a financial incentive is above 5%, the difference must be deducted from the purchase price. We can only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the discounted purchase price or valuation.

**Not acceptable sources of deposit**

* **Unsecured credit facilities or personal borrowing**<br><br>Money that is borrowed by the customer other than by way of a legal mortgage over property owned by them and will need to be repaid at any point in the future must not represent any element of the deposit.
* **Concessionary**<br><br>We can only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the lower of the 'discounted' purchase price or valuation. This will ensure that the customer(s) are contributing a deposit to the purchase rather than relying on any equity within the property to fund this.
* **Gifted deposit not from immediate family**<br><br>A deposit that is gifted that does not fall in the above acceptable categories of gifted deposit from family member or gifted deposit from occupier not named on mortgage.
* **Vendor gifted deposit**<br><br>Any incentives provided by the vendor should be discounted from the purchase price. We can only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the discounted purchase price or valuation.

Please note that this is not exhaustive and a source of deposit not listed above can be considered subject to there being no element of personal borrowing (e.g. Personal Loan, other loan from a family member/third party, director's loan, Credit Card, Overdraft) or a gift from a third party not listed as acceptable.

### Energy Efficient Homes

EEH products are available for Purchase and Remortgage applications up to £2million, and where the property has an Energy Performance Certificate rating of A or B. Please refer to the [product finder](https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/products/) for our current range.

To check an EPC rating, please refer to the Government website: [find an energy certificate](https://www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate).

A PEA rated property will be a new build property, PEA certificates are provided by the Developer.

If the PEA certificate has limited address information please also provide the Plot Reservation form for the property (also provided by the Developer).

### Independent Legal Advice

Independent Legal Advice (ILA) is the process where a person is advised by their own solicitor or licensed conveyancer, in a face to face meeting in the absence of the borrower and other interested parties, as to the consequences for them of executing a mortgage deed and agreeing to secure new borrowing on a property they own or will own.

HSBC's policy is that the owner(s) of a property must be advised of the legal consequences of providing a mortgage over it to secure residential lending. This will help ensure that the bank's security is enforceable against the borrower(s) and the owner(s) of the property, that customers are treated fairly and that the bank is lending responsibly.

As a result, HSBC requires ILA in the following scenarios:

* There is a difference of more than £50,000 between one or more individual owners the owner benefiting least will require ILA
* The funds are being gifted to a third party) and the difference in benefit to the third party compared to owners is more than £50,000. In this instance ILA is required for all owners/borrowers.
* Exception – ILA is not required where the difference in benefit is less than £50,000, regardless of funds being used for individual owners or gifted to a third party. It is also not required where funds are for school fees for a dependent child under the age of 18.
* The funds are being injected into a business that is not 100% owned by the property owner/s and the difference in benefit to the business compared to the property owners is more than £50,000.
* Where the business is 100% owned by the property owner/s, ILA is recommended.

**ILA Costs**

The customer is responsible for all ILA-related fees, and should consult their chosen ILA firm for the exact cost. Where ILA is mandatory and the application is going through the LMS panel, there is an additional fee payable to the LMS panel firm for the additional work associated with this.

**Guidance on who provides the ILA**

If an LMS panel is acting for HSBC as part of the transaction, the customer must instruct a different firm to provide the ILA. LMS act for HSBC in the following applications and so a conflict of interest would result if the firm were also to provide the ILA:

* Remortgage
* Unencumbered HOL
* Shared Ownership *
* Transfer of Title

*We currently do not provide this specific type of mortgage through HSBC intermediary channel.

The person receiving ILA can use a solicitor or licenced conveyancer who they know to provide this service or they can find one by visiting:

* England and Wales: [http://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/?Pro=True](http://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/?Pro=True)

### Interest only

Single applicants requesting a residential interest-only mortgage will be required to have an annual minimum income £75,000 which must meet our income eligibility criteria below. For joint applications at least one applicant must have an annual minimum income of £75,000.

**Eligible income sources:**

* Employed income: basic + fixed allowances (excluding bonus, commission, overtime and rental income)
* Self employed income: net profits + director's salary
* Pension
* Benefit income

With an interest only loan, the maximum term is 25 years (subject to maximum age policy) and the minimum term is 5 years. The maximum LTV is 75% for both remortgage or purchase applications dependent on the size of the loan. Customers meeting the eligibility criteria can now take homeowner loans/further advances lending on interest only terms up to a maximum LTV of 60 per cent.

**Acceptable repayment plans**

* Ad hoc Capital (lending is capped at 50% LTV. Additional repayment vehicles can be used for lending above this LTV)
* Savings
* Endowments
* Stocks and Shares ISA
* Investments
* Sale of Other Property

Please note that our affordability assessment will be based on a Capital Repayment basis.

For more details, please see [Interest Only Repayment Plans](https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/resources/).

We are unable to accept the following as a suitable repayment plan:

* Sale of current or planned main residence at the end of the term
* Sale of commercial or overseas property
* Lump sum from a personal or occupational pension scheme – because of frequent changes to pension policies and regulations which make assessment of credibility difficult.

Interest Only loans are restricted to Interest Only LTV limits and Interest Only maximum terms. However any additional lending can be added on a Capital Repayment basis with the additional lending restricted to Capital Repayment LTV limits and terms. Please refer to Loan section for further details.

### Loan

The minimum amount we can lend is £10,000. The minimum property value we accept is £50,000.

There is no maximum loan amount restriction for residential mortgages, as long as the application meets all other criteria.

[Specific Types of Property and Applicant](https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/criteria/?tab=residential#)

### Offer extension

For Purchase applications an offer extension may be requested within the last 30 days of the original offer expiry date.

For new build properties the offer extension will be for 90 calendar days (from date of expiry of the original offer)

For non-new build properties, the offer extension will be for 30 calendar days (from date of expiry of the original offer)

Please note: this applies to new build properties only. New build properties are defined as under construction and will be occupied for the first time. Properties that are recently constructed which are awaiting certification are also covered.

To request an offer extension please complete an [Application Amendment Form](https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/resources/).

Please note, you can only request one offer extension per mortgage application. No changes can be made once the original offer expiry date has passed. If you do require changes within the extension period, or a further extension, a new application will be required.

### Offer validity

Mortgage offers are valid for 180 days from the date the offer document is issued.

If any revised offer is issued outside the last 14 days of the original offer expiry date, this will retain the original offer expiry date.

If a change request is approved within the last 14 days of the original offer expiry date, then a 14 day cooling off / reflection validity period will be given from date of issue of the revised offer. Please note that only one request to make a change (within the last 14 days of the original offer expiry date) can be made. Where further changes are requested, this will require a full rekey of the application.

### Offset mortgages

HSBC does not currently provide offset mortgages

### Payments

Standard payments can only be made by Direct Debit.

Please ensure that the Direct Debit details provided in the application have been checked to ensure that they are:

* For a personal account in the customer(s) name (please be advised that we cannot accepted a Direct Debit mandate set up on a business account, for a Residential mortgage however this can be set up on a Business account for a BTL mortgage)
* For an account that supports Direct Debit payments (for example a savings account would not usually support a Direct Debit mandate)
* For an open / active account (that will remain open/active upon completion of the Mortgage).

Payments can be claimed on any day of the month. In 30 day months, payments due on the 31st would be taken on the 1st of the following month.

A minimum of 28 days must elapse from drawdown to the first repayment being taken for all loan types. If the preferred date of payment falls within 28 days of drawdown – we will claim the first payment in the following month. e.g. Loan is drawn down on 1st July and the preferred repayment date is 20th, we will claim the first repayment on the 20th August.

This first payment would include interest calculated from 1st July to the 20th August. A letter is issued to the customer(s) upon drawdown confirming the payment due date and amount.

### Procuration fees

**What Procuration fee will I be paid?**

* Residential applications: 0.4%
* Product Transfers: 0.2%
* BTL applications: 0.5%

Please note: The fee is payable on the amount drawn down at completion, not the figure shown on the illustration.

**When is payment made?**

We process proc fees based on the previous week's application completions. The fee should reach your Network within 3-4 weeks following completion, allowing for internal accounting processes.

Please contact your Network in the first instance to chase an outstanding fee.

If not received after four weeks post completion, please contact our team on intermediary.proc.fees@hsbc.com detailing the application number and customer's name.

**What details do the Networks receive?**

The remittance statement is sent weekly to each Network.

These include the following details, Network name, Firm name, drawdown date, submission date, customer name, address, property address, account number, mortgage purpose, mortgage total, commission, application reference and broker name.

**I can't find my Mortgage Club when registering, how will I get paid?**

When registering the Mortgage Club is not available as an option, only the Network.

In the background we have the firm's relevant payment route assigned to ensure the fee is paid to the correct Mortgage Club.

**Can I change my own payment route?**

No, a broker cannot choose a mortgage club for their payment.

This is agreed by the Network per their contract with HSBC UK.

If there is any error, or the firm are wanting to revise the agreed payment route, we require confirmation in writing from the firm's director on headed paper.

**Where does my fee get paid if I change Network?**

If you submit an application which has not completed prior to you moving to a new Network, the procuration fee will be paid to the originating Network.

**The Network has clawed back a fee; how do I get it back?**

HSBC UK will only ever claw a fee back if the account has closed and funds have been returned following completion.

These are checked monthly, and Networks will be notified on their weekly statements.

If a fee has been paid in advance via your Mortgage Club which has subsequently been clawed back, it is likely the case has not completed within their allocated timeframe.

Please contact us on intermediary.proc.fees@hsbc.com and we can help locate and provide you with further details.

### Remortgage Loan

HSBC can only lend the amount required by the existing lender for redemption. This means if the lending requested is greater than the redemption figure, the customer will not receive the surplus funds.

### Standard variable rate

The HSBC UK Standard Variable Rate is currently 6.49%.

### Term

**Minimum term**

The minimum term is 5 years (60 months)

**Maximum term**

Subject to Lending into retirement criteria, the following maximum term criteria applies:

| Capital Repayment | 40 years (480 months) | Purchase<br><br>Remortgages – like for like remortgages<br><br>No additional borrowing other than where a product fee is being capitalised<br><br>Lending must be against the main residence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | 40 years (480 months) | Home Loans – new monies (including Home Loan linked to a remortgage)<br><br>Home Loans secured against an Unencumbered property<br><br>Foreign Currency and Foreign National loans<br><br>Any application for lending against a second home<br><br>Care: if the overall LTV is >90% and the term is >35 years then the lending will be assessed for affordability over a 35 year term. The online calculator will complete these checks and will provide an accurate calculation as to lending figures (Brokers would just need to complete the calculator based on requested term and will not need to manually calculate over a shorter term). |
| Interest Only | 25 years (300 months) | All applications |

**Split terms**

We can split a mortgage into two separate terms, e.g. 15 years Capital Repayment and 10 years Interest Only. Under this scenario, two fees may be payable if a different rate is chosen for each loan part.

## Property

### Annexe / Granny flat

In order to be considered suitable security, properties with an annexe/annexes must meet the following requirements:

* The size of the annexe must be proportionate in size and smaller than the main dwelling.
* If the annex is on a separate legal title, it will not be included in the valuation.
* The saleability of the main property should not be adversely affected by the presence of the annexe.
* Vacant possession is required purchase cases.

The following criteria will NOT be acceptable:

* Non-residential uses for the annexe (e.g. Airbnb, guest house, commercial live/work, office or shop).
* If there is any evidence that the access rights to the main property run through the land in the annex title, unless a charge was also taken over the annex title.

The bank will be guided by the type of valuation received and any additional guidance from the valuer (in cases where a PV has been completed).

### Commercial property close by

We can lend against residential properties with commercial properties close by, subject to the valuer's comments that the property is suitable security.

### Discounted properties

We can only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the lower of the 'discounted' purchase price or valuation. This will ensure that customers are contributing a deposit to the purchase, rather than relying on any equity in the property to fund this.

### Family-discounted purchase

Where the property is a discounted purchase from a family member, we will only lend up to the maximum allowable LTV of the lower of the 'discounted' purchase price or valuation. We will also require the solicitor or licensed conveyancer to satisfy themselves that the family member gifting the property is not insolvent and to arrange suitable indemnity insurance for the full value of the property if they deem it necessary.

Please note, when an applicant is purchasing a property from a family member separate legal representation is required. It is HSBC policy that the same solicitor or licensed conveyancer cannot act for both seller and buyer.

### Flats

The maximum LTV borrowing on a flat is 90%. For new build flats this reduces to 85%. Ex-local authority flats have a maximum LTV of 80%.

If you intend to capitalise a booking fee then the loan amount plus the added fee must remain within the LTV restrictions stated above.

The above maximum LTV also only applies where the total loan size is not exceeded.

Please refer to the Loan section for further information on LTV limits.

In order to be considered suitable for mortgage purposes, flats must be habitable with a fully functioning internal kitchen and bathroom and with no restrictions on occupancy.

Investor led properties (i.e. where the majority of the units within a building are not owner occupied) are not accepted.

Buildings insurance covering the full cost of re-building the flat must be in place for the duration of the term of the mortgage.

We will not normally lend where:

* The block is above four storeys high and there is no lift;
* Where the lease of the flat / maisonette does not contain adequate covenants and arrangements in respect of the common services in line with our instructions to the Conveyancer. This will form part of the conveyancing checks or
* The property is in an ex-local authority high rise block with seven or more floors.

Please note, while blocks of flats with more than 4 floors including the ground floor with no lift are normally considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes, some exceptions can be made. Good quality, private sector purpose build or converted blocks of flats in prestigious areas of central London or in prime city centres (where the benefits of city living outweigh the unusual market resistance to high rise blocks, exhibiting strong saleability, in excellent condition and with sustainable re-sale potential) may be considered on individual merit by the valuer.

In all cases, we will require the valuer to confirm that the flat is both mortgageable and marketable.

Where the valuer identifies evidence of cladding on a property, additional checks and an EWS1 (External Wall Fire Review) form may be required to determine whether the cladding material meets minimum safety standards or is defective.

An EWS1 form will be required in the following circumstances:

**For buildings over six storeys:**

* There is cladding or curtain wall glazing on the building or
* there are balconies which stack vertically above each other and either both the balustrades and decking are constructed with combustible materials (e.g. timber) or the decking is constructed with combustible materials and the balconies are directly linked by combustible material.

**For buildings of five or six storeys**

* There is a significant amount of cladding on the building (for the purpose of this guidance, approximately one quarter of the whole elevation estimated from what is visible standing at ground level is a significant amount) or
* there are ACM, MCM or HPL panels on the building* or
* there are balconies which stack vertically above each other and either both the balustrades and decking are constructed with combustible materials (e.g. timber), or the decking is constructed with combustible materials and the balconies are directly linked by combustible materials or
* there is cladding around the main route of escape or linking multiple floors of a building with potential to promote the spread of fire, even if less than one quarter of whole elevation.

**For buildings of four storeys or fewer:**

* There are ACM, MCM or HPL panels on the building*

* Note: metal cladding and ACM/MCM are visually very similar, so if metal panel cladding is present an EWS1 inspection should be requested unless the valuer is satisfied that the cladding is not ACM/MCM and can fully justify their decision.

Where properties have failed their EWS1/FRAEW assessment. We will consider lending on the following properties:

* In Wales, those covered by the Welsh Government's funded remediation schemes.
* In England, if the property is to be remediated under a suitable remediation scheme or leaseholders are protected under the provisions of the Building Safety Act 2022.
* New to bank buy to let properties in England and Wales may be considered for lending where there is evidence, they will be fully remediated within 6 months, and it is confirmed that the leaseholder would not be liable for any costs associated with the remediation.

*Note – there are currently no remediation schemes for properties of 11m/4 storeys or less.

The following information may also be requested:

* Confirmation of any contribution that the leaseholder is liable for in respect to any proposed programme of remediation works.
* Confirmation of any start date for remediation works.
* If providing details of a remediation scheme (as above) then no EWS1 form is required.

The bank will be guided by the valuer to confirm the suitability of the property for mortgage purposes.

New to bank Buy to Let where remediation will not be complete within 6 months and Second Home applications are not considered suitable for the remediation scheme lending.

For properties in Scotland and Northern Ireland where the EWS1 form confirms that the property does not meet minimum safety standards, the property will be deemed unsuitable for mortgage lending and we will be unable to proceed with an application.

Where an EWS1 form is required in respect of the building, it should be signed by a person holding a qualification from an organisation included in the EWS-Form List of Relevant Professional Bodies.

The documentation must be fully completed and be accompanied by a letter on company headed paper from the signing firm which details their area of business, qualifications and confirms they completed the form.

### Studio flats

There are no restrictions on studio flats. We can lend, subject to valuer's comments that the property is suitable security.

### Inherited properties

Where a customer has inherited a property, how the property is registered at the Land Registry determines the application type:

**Purchase application:**

* The property is not registered in the applicant's name e.g. the property is still registered in the name of the deceased, and there may or may not be a mortgage in the name of the deceased
* or
* The applicant is a joint owner but they need to purchase the remaining share due to a 'Tenants in common' restriction in place.

**Remortgage application:**

* The property is registered in the applicant's name
* or
* The applicant is a joint owner with the deceased and the property was held as joint tenants rather than tenants in common.

### Japanese knotweed

Japanese Knotweed is an invasive plant that grows rapidly and can cause structural damage to buildings and roads.

Where Japanese Knotweed has not been identified within the boundaries of the property, but is present on neighbouring land within three metres of the boundary, the valuer will report this to the bank but no remediating action should be required.

Where Japanese Knotweed has been identified within the boundaries of the property being mortgaged to the Bank, we can proceed where there is no visible damage to outbuildings, paths and fences. We will rely on the valuer to assess the damage or any restrictions to access which may be caused by the presence of Japanese Knotweed and to confirm whether a specialist report is required. If so, we will require the following:

* A treatment plan which has been fully completed by an appropriately qualified person or company such as an accredited member of an industry recognised trade association such as the Property Care Association and the Invasive Non-Native Specialists Association
* A Completion Certificate that confirms the weed has already been fully remediated with a minimum 10 year insurance backed guarantee in place
* A copy of the Completion Certificate and Guarantee are to be provided to the valuer for their confirmation that the property is suitable for mortgage security and whether there is any impact on the valuation of the property

Note: Where the valuer confirms there is no visible damage and the property is acceptable for mortgage purposes, the presence of Japanese Knotweed could still impact the value.

### Location

HSBC can provide mortgages in mainland England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Scottish Isles.

### New build

We define a new build property as one that will be occupied for the first time and/or has been built and completed within the last 24 months.

Although we can approve mortgages on properties not yet built subject to satisfactory valuation, we will not release funds until the property has been completed. A re-inspection may be required if the surveyor advises one is necessary in their original valuation.

Standard lending criteria apply subject to:

* A maximum 90% LTV for houses. The maximum LTV only applies where the total loan size is not exceeded as set out in the Loan section.
* A maximum of 85% LTV for flats The maximum LTV only applies where the total loan size is not exceeded as set out in the Loan section.
* A structural defects warranty being in place.

#### New Build Incentives

**Financial Incentives**

Financial incentives up to 5% of the property price are acceptable without impacting property value.

Where the value of a financial incentive is above 5%, the difference must still be deducted from the purchase price for LTV purposes.

**Non-Financial Incentives**

Any non-financial incentives offered by a builder / developer are acceptable without impacting LTV.

Any incentives either financial or non-financial must still be declared.

#### New home warranty schemes - Structural defects warranty / insurance

It is a requirement that where a property has been built or converted within the last 10 years (purchase application) or two years (remortgage /unencumbered additional borrowing application), it has the benefit of a suitable new home warranty (Structural defects warranty / SDW) or Professional Consultants Certificate in place from the practical completion of the property.

**Acceptable**

**New home warranty schemes:**

* ABC+ Warranty
* Advantage HCI
* Ark Insurance Group Ltd
* Build Assure New Homes/Build Assure 10
* Building Life Plans (BLP)
* Build-Zone New Home Warranty
* Checkmate Castle 10 Home Warranty
* Global Home Warranties Ltd
* Homeproof – formerly known as Aedis Warranties Ltd
* International Construction Warranties Ltd (ICW)
* Local Authority Building Control (LABC) New Home Warranty
* NHBC
* One Guarantee
* Premier Guarantee
* Protek
* The Q Policy

**Professional Consultants Certificate (PCC)**

A PCC is only acceptable for newly built homes within a development of no more than 10 properties.

If the property is a flat or maisonette, a PCC must be available for the common parts and the structure of the building if these are part of the new build/conversion works.

The professional consultant should have one or more of the following qualifications:

* fellow or member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (FRICS or MRICS); or
* fellow or member of the Institution of Structural Engineers (F.I.Struct.E or M.I.Struct.E); or
* fellow or member of the Chartered Institute of Building (FCIOB or MCIOB); or
* fellow or member of the Architecture and Surveying Institute (FASI or MASI) (only if in conjunction with a FCIOB or MCIOB qualification); or
* fellow or member of the Chartered Association of Building Engineers (C.Build E MCABE or C.Build E FCABE); or
* member of the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (MCIAT); or
* architect registered with the Architects Registration Board (ARB). An architect must be registered with the Architects Registration Board, even if also a member of another institution, for example the Royal Institute of Ulster Architects (RSUA); or
* fellow or member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (FICE or MICE).

If the PCC is issued by a Warranty provider, they must be on the approved list of new home warranty schemes above.

PLEASE NOTE: The Professional Consultant's Certificate (PCC) must be in the format set by UKF Lenders Handbook for Conveyancers with no changes from the standard template.

**Unacceptable**

* Retrospective warranties are not acceptable ie warranties only obtained after the property has been built. This is because the warranty provider will not have carried out any inspections during construction, so they offer no assurance that the property was suitably constructed
* Retrospective PCC's from a professional who has not supervised the project from the start and inspected the build at regular intervals are not acceptable
* The latent defects policy obtainable through HBUK insurers is not a suitable policy to cover the lack of the above warranties for residential mortgage purposes

### Non-standard construction types

Properties constructed using non-standard or non-traditional methods maybe unacceptable for mortgage purposes or lending maybe restricted.

The list below is not exhaustive. HSBC will rely on the valuer's comments.

#### Timber-framed

Timber-framed properties constructed between 1920 and 1965 are considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes due to inferior building regulations in relation to vapour barriers.

Scottwood/Swedish are also considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes.

#### All timber

Due to the unusual nature of the construction, properties made entirely from timber are usually considered restricted. We will be guided by the valuer's comments on marketability. If acceptable, they will be subject to a maximum LTV of 80%

#### Wimpey No Fines and Laing Easiform

Properties dated from 1945 onwards are acceptable, subject to the valuer's comments, at the lower LTV ratio of 80%.

Bear in mind that Wimpey No-Fines properties are currently being monitored in the north of England where some deterioration has been noted. If this construction type is subsequently defined as 'defective', this could have a significant impact on the value and saleability of the property.

#### Steel frame

Water penetration and condensation can cause corrosion of the steel frame causing instability of the property. These properties are acceptable subject to a satisfactory structural engineer's report, at the lower LTV ratio of 80%.

Livett Cartwright steel frames, Hawthorn Leslie steel frames with boarded finish, and BISF (British Iron and Steel Federation) are considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes.

#### Kit-built

The following 'kit-built' type of constructions with special architectural merit or proven long-term durability are considered restricted with a maximum LTV of 80%, subject to usual warranty provision if less than 10 years old:

* Huf Haus
* Potton
* Skandia-Hus
* Border Oak (and other bulk timber kit forms)
* Colt/Guildway (these types are subject to an entirely satisfactory valuer statement of condition and saleability, which could be enhanced by location if they are found on larger rural or semi-rural plots)

#### Durisol

Durisol houses are accepted up to 80% LTV, subject to a satisfactory structural engineer's report. Durisol flats are considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes.

#### Mundic block

Properties containing mundic block materials (primarily situated in Cornwall & Devon) must be tested using the screening test developed by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The results of the test will be considered as follows:

* A = Suitable for mortgage purposes
* A/B = Restricted, acceptable at up to 80% LTV, subject to valuer's comments
* B = Unacceptable for mortgage purposes
* C = Unacceptable for mortgage purposes

#### Bellrock

Load bearing gypsum plaster panel construction is considered unacceptable for mortgage purposes.

### Overages

For new HSBC UK mortgage customers we will not provide lending where a property is subject to an overage agreement.

For existing HSBC UK mortgage customers we will not accept a request for a new overage agreement, but where a property already has an existing overage agreement requests for new lending can be accepted.

### Part domestic / Part commercial

We can lend where the commercial element represents a minor part of the property, providing the whole property can be sold as a complete residential unit.

For example:

* A single room used by the borrower for home-working would be acceptable.
* A single room used by the borrower where there will be commercial callers and/or other staff present would be considered as commercial use and would not be acceptable.

We cannot provide residential mortgage facilities on a property that is used wholly for business purposes or where there are commercial buildings on the same title (for example, a holiday let/cottage).

### Properties bought at auction

Applications for properties purchased at auction are acceptable.

Once the customer has had their bid accepted the application needs to be submitted as soon as possible so the valuation can be instructed immediately. Applications cannot be submitted prior to the bid being accepted.

Solicitors will need to complete the legal formalities before the purchase is finalised.

Customers must understand that a mortgage offer will not be generated by the bank until a satisfactory valuation has been completed and it has been credit underwritten.

Buildings insurance must be in place at time of exchange of contracts.

### Restrictive covenants

We cannot provide lending for properties with covenants that restrict the period of occupation and/or the age or type of employment of the occupant.

### Second kitchens

Exceptionally, we can lend against properties with 2 kitchens, subject to the valuer's comments that the property is suitable security.

### Second property

We can provide mortgages for second homes if both loans can be serviced entirely from the applicant's salary, subject to our normal credit assessment. This is limited to one property in addition to the applicant's main residence and subject to the below:

* A maximum of two residential properties per applicant can be owned upon completion
* Includes properties that are mortgaged (including on consent to let), unencumbered, abroad or offshore, partially or wholly owned
* HSBC Mortgage lending is limited to a maximum of 80% per property.

If you intend to capitalise a booking fee, this can exceed the LTV restrictions of the selected product and policy (in circumstances where only adding the fee has caused the LTV breach). Please be aware that a booking fee cannot be capitalised where adding the fee will breach a 95% LTV policy limit.

The above maximum LTV also only applies where the total loan size is not exceeded.

Please refer to the Loan section for further information on LTV limits.

* Both properties must be for occupation/use by the customer or immediate family, ie spouse, children or parent(s)
* The property must not be let out.
* 'Other outgoings' should include council tax, utility, insurance and property maintenance bills for any residential properties other than the property in the application
* Second properties are subject to a maximum term of 40 years

### Security

HSBC only provides mortgages and Homeowner loans where:

* The security is direct – i.e. where the property owners and borrowers are exactly the same.
* A first legal charge (in Scotland, a first ranking standard security) over the property is/will be held. We do not provide second charge (second ranking) mortgages.
* The property must be either freehold (which includes common hold), or leasehold.
* All Residential leasehold properties must have more than 30 years remaining on the lease beyond the term of the mortgage at the outset.

We will not provide residential lending in the following circumstances:

* The security is indirect – i.e. where the property owners and borrowers are not the same.
* The property is being purchased via a sub-sale transaction (this includes back to back transfers and assignment of contracts).
* The property is subject to an onerous Lease clause regarding an excessive or unreasonably escalating ground rent.
* A sole owner where a declaration of trust is to be created

We will not provide residential mortgages for:

* Properties with Agricultural or other restrictions.
* House Boats i.e. boats that are used as a house, not to be confused with properties on which there is a boat house used to store or keep a vessel.
* Mobile homes.
* Construction of a new property or the conversion to/refurbishment (Home Improvements excluded) of a residential property.
* Uninhabitable properties (ie do not have an internal working kitchen and bathroom).
* Residential Properties which are also used for Commercial purposes.
* Properties not in the UK.
* Holiday Homes that cannot be lived in all year round.
* Part Domestic/Part Commercial property that is used wholly for business purposes or where there are commercial buildings on the same title (for example holiday let/cottage).
* Restrictions on occupancy, e.g. covenants that restrict the period of occupation and/or the type of occupant (age or occupation).
* Live/work units.
* Investor led properties (i.e. where the majority of the units within a building are not owner occupied).
* Flats in buildings originally constructed as offices.
* Overseas properties.

### Self-build

We do not lend to fund construction of a new property or the conversion to or renovation of a residential property.

### Solar panels

We will consider applications from properties with leased solar panels where the lease complies with the UK Finance Handbook minimum requirements for lease of roof space.

### Standard properties

Other than house boats and mobile homes, there is no particular type of property that we cannot lend against subject to the property meeting our non-standard construction type criteria.

In order to be considered suitable for mortgage purposes, properties must be habitable with a fully functioning internal kitchen and bathroom and with no restrictions on occupancy.

Buildings insurance covering the full cost of re-building the property must be taken out and must remain in place during the term of the mortgage.

### Tenure

The following types of tenure are acceptable:

#### England, Wales and Northern Ireland

* Freehold, Leasehold Commonhold houses and bungalows
* Flying freeholds (where these are a feature of local housing)
* Freehold flats/maisonettes where the security will comprise the freehold of the full building within which the flat is contained and there are no more than four flats in total, and the borrower is in residence; Coach Houses subject to suitable building insurance and acceptable lease of garage; and a Tyneside flats arrangement (where there are two flats in a block and the leaseholder of one flat is the freeholder of the other flat in the building and vice versa).
* Leasehold flats (including flats with a share of the Freehold in blocks of no more than four flats - subject to our customer owning a share of the freehold).

All leasehold properties must have more than 50 years remaining after completion of term of the mortgage. If this criteria is met, however the unexpired term, as at application submission date, has less than 85 years remaining, this will always be subject to the valuer's opinion. The valuer must be satisfied that there is a market for any property taking the lease term into consideration

Leasehold properties must NOT be subject to an onerous lease clause regarding an excessive or unreasonably escalating ground rent (Purchases only)

Lease terms such as ground rents must be reasonable at all times during the term of the lease and adhere to our requirements below:

* This criteria applies to i) properties subject to a lease granted before the Leasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Act 2022 came into force on 30 June 2022; or ii) Leases which were contractually agreed (i.e. contracts exchanged) prior to the Leasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Act 2022 but not granted until after 30 June 2022
* Maximum Ground Rent p.a. must not exceed £250 (£1,000 in Greater London). If there is the potential (within the lease provisions) for the annual ground rent to exceed the applicable level, it should be reduced to within the required threshold. This would require a lease variation on the lines that under no circumstances could reviewed rent be increased so that it comes within the applicable Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) threshold in the Housing Act 1988 (as amended) or in any legislation amending or replacing it or in any subordinate legislation issued under it. If the lease cannot be varied, a suitable indemnity policy must be put in place to protect the risk to the Bank
* Ground Rent less than or equal to 0.2% of the current property value (New Builds restricted to 0.1%)
* Grounds Rent review period greater than or equal to 10 years
* Ground Rent escalation less than or equal to Retail Price Index (RPI). Any RPI increase must not exceed the AST thresholds
* Ground Rent doubles every 20 years or any longer period and does not continue to double after 125 years. Any doubling of ground rent must not be capable of exceeding the AST thresholds.

The ground rent for Leases contractually agreed to after the Leasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Act 2022 came into force on 30 June 2022 should be limited to a peppercorn.

#### Scotland

* All properties with outright ownership referred to as former Feuhold/Absolute or Heritable title (this ownership is equivalent to a freehold title)
* Leasehold title is not acceptable.

### Unacceptable properties

* Uninhabitable properties - For a property to be confirmed as habitable you must be able to reside there, and it must have a functional kitchen, bathroom and toilet.

Where an application is for additional borrowing for Home Improvements to kitchens or bathrooms it can be considered habitable where these fittings are being replaced as part of the home improvements, as long as the other areas of the building remain fully habitable. In all cases a property must remain wind and watertight, secure, and fully covered by building insurance under normal terms.

Renovation of properties cannot be financed by way of a residential mortgage (except in extenuating circumstances for existing HSBC UK mortgage customers where this would be in the interests of the customer and the Bank, such as flood or fire damage. Please contact your BDM or our helpdesk for further information). [https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/broker-support/]

* Residential Properties which are also used for Commercial purposes.

If the PEA certificate has limited address information please also provide the Plot Reservation form for the property (also provided by the Developer).

## Valuations

### Criteria

To determine whether a property is suitable security for a mortgage loan, we will use either an automated valuation, digital valuation, managed desktop valuation or physical valuation.

We offer a free Standard Valuation or Scottish Transcript as part of the application journey, which is for the banks mortgage lending purposes only. This must not be relied upon to identify any structural defects present in the property.

If your customer wishes to be satisfied regarding the structural condition of the proposed property, they must arrange an appropriate survey. Please see the section Type of Valuation for more detail.

All valuations and mortgage offers are valid for six months. Applications not completed within this time frame will be cancelled.

The minimum acceptable property valuation amount is £50,000.

An Automated Valuation (AVM), Digital Valuation (DV), Managed Desktop Valuation (MDV) or Physical Valuation (PV) must be used to determine whether a property is suitable security for a mortgage loan.

Please note that a valuation is carried out for the banks mortgage lending purposes only.

If an acceptable Managed Desktop Valuation (MDV) has been completed which is suitable for our lending purposes, even if the property has been valued less than expected, a Physical Valuation (PV) will not be undertaken.

We will only complete a subsequent Physical Valuation (PV) if the property has been valued less than expected, and it affects the amount of lending and/or the LTV rates available.

The type of valuation required is dependent on certain factors and a drive-by valuation cannot be used to support mortgage borrowing.

A Physical Valuation is mandatory for all New Build properties less than two years old.

### Down valued cases

Where a property is down valued, an appeal can be raised if the figure provided by the valuer is lower than the expected property value by 20% or more, and the LTV, rate or lending amount has been impacted.

E.g. Expected purchase price is £100k but the physical valuation returns a figure of £80k.

If the property down valuation does not fall within the 20% tolerance, an appeal cannot be raised.

The appeal must be received in a written format and all minimum criteria detailed below is mandatory. If the criteria is not fulfilled the appeal will not be progressed. Please contact us on 0345 600 5847 to begin your appeal.

**Minimum Accepted Criteria:**

* Evidence of a minimum 3 properties sold within the last 6 months, of the same property type, number of bedrooms, gross floor area and ideally in the same post code area (within a 1-mile radius)
* Details of any home improvements or key information that could justify an increased figure
* Property address and postcode (including house number)
* Property type and number of bedrooms
* Description/comments
* Date sold and sale price

**Unacceptable Evidence:**

* Estate Agents Market appraisal/opinion - this is an Estate Agents personal opinion of what they could market the property for, there is no obligation or guarantee that the figure will be achieved as a realised sale
* Independent survey - this is completed for the customer's own purposes and doesn't take into consideration the bank's Policies and Lending Criteria
* Properties that are currently on the market or sold subject to contract - until a sale is complete, they are not considered as suitable evidence

Please note that a valuation is carried out for the banks mortgage lending purposes only.

If an acceptable Managed Desktop Valuation (MDV) has been completed which is suitable for our lending purposes, even if the property has been valued less than expected, a Physical Valuation (PV) will not be undertaken.

We will only complete a subsequent Physical Valuation (PV) if the property has been valued less than expected, and it affects the amount of lending and/or the LTV rates available.

### Existing valuations

An existing valuation previously used to support mortgage lending can be used if:

* the valuation was undertaken by a surveyor from our current panel;
* is dated within the last six months; and
* the proposed borrowing has an LTV equal to or less than 70 per cent; or
* the proposed borrowing is interest only and has an LTV equal to or less than 60 per cent.

Physical Valuations greater than six months old cannot be used to support further borrowing and a new valuation will be required in accordance with current policy.

### Northern Ireland / Scotland properties

**Northern Ireland properties**

An Automated Valuation (AVM) cannot be used to support mortgage facilities in Northern Ireland and all borrowing requests must be supported by a Managed Desktop Valuation (MDV) or Physical Valuation (PV).

**Scottish properties**

**Scottish Home Buyer report – Purchase applications only**

These valuations can be accepted only under the following conditions:

* The date of the Scottish single survey is equal to or less than three months old when submitted
* The overall loan to valuation ratio (LTV) is equal to or less than 60 per cent.

Where the LTV is above 60 per cent the single survey report can be used where:

* It is equal to or less than three months old
* The value given is within the product and application LTV criteria
* We can obtain a re-type from our valuation panel

Where the single survey is older than three months and/or the surveyor is not on our supplier's panel we are unable to use the survey and a new Physical Valuation (PV) will be required.

### Properties with cladding

Where the valuer identifies evidence of cladding on a property, additional checks and an EWS1 (External Wall Fire Review) form may be required to determine whether the cladding material meets minimum safety standards or is defective.

An EWS1 form will be required in the following circumstances:

**For buildings over six storeys:**

* There is cladding or curtain wall glazing on the building or
* there are balconies which stack vertically above each other and either both the balustrades and decking are constructed with combustible materials (e.g. timber) or the decking is constructed with combustible materials and the balconies are directly linked by combustible material.

**For buildings of five or six storeys:**

* There is a significant amount of cladding on the building (for the purpose of this guidance, approximately one quarter of the whole elevation estimated from what is visible standing at ground level is a significant amount) or
* there are ACM, MCM or HPL panels on the building* or
* there are balconies which stack vertically above each other and either both the balustrades and decking are constructed with combustible materials (e.g. timber), or the decking is constructed with combustible materials and the balconies are directly linked by combustible materials or
* there is cladding around the main route of escape or linking multiple floors of a building with potential to promote the spread of fire, even if less than one quarter of whole elevation.

**For buildings of four storeys or fewer:**

* There are ACM, MCM or HPL panels on the building*

* Note: metal cladding and ACM/MCM are visually very similar, so if metal panel cladding is present an EWS1 inspection should be requested unless the valuer is satisfied that the cladding is not ACM/MCM and can fully justify their decision.

Where properties have failed their EWS1/FRAEW assessment. We will consider lending on the following properties:

* In Wales, those covered by the Welsh Government's funded remediation schemes.
* In England, if the property is to be remediated under a suitable remediation scheme or leaseholders are protected under the provisions of the Building Safety Act 2022.
* New to bank buy to let properties in England and Wales may be considered for lending where there is evidence, they will be fully remediated within 6 months, and it is confirmed that the leaseholder would not be liable for any costs associated with the remediation.

*Note – there are currently no remediation schemes for properties of 11m/4 storeys or less.

The following information may also be requested:

* Confirmation of any contribution that the leaseholder is liable for in respect to any proposed programme of remediation works.
* Confirmation of any start date for remediation works.
* If providing details of a remediation scheme (as above) then no EWS1 form is required.

The bank will be guided by the valuer to confirm the suitability of the property for mortgage purposes.

New to bank Buy to Let where remediation will not be complete within 6 months and Second Home applications are not considered suitable for the remediation scheme lending.

For properties in Scotland and Northern Ireland where the EWS1 form confirms that the property does not meet minimum safety standards, the property will be deemed unsuitable for mortgage lending and we will be unable to proceed with an application.

Where an EWS1 form is required in respect of the building, it should be signed by a person holding a qualification from an organisation included in the EWS-Form List of Relevant Professional Bodies.

The documentation must be fully completed and be accompanied by a letter on company headed paper from the signing firm which details their area of business, qualifications and confirms they completed the form.

### Type of valuation

HSBC UK only offer a Standard Valuation or a Scottish Transcript as part of our application process.

If you require a more detailed type of valuation report (i.e. Homebuyers or Buildings Survey) you can source this independently using the services of an appropriately qualified surveyor, details of which can be found via the [RICS website](https://www.rics.org/).

## Solicitor / Conveyancer

### Appointing a Solicitor / Conveyancer

**Customer chooses their own Solicitor or Licensed Conveyancer firm**

Once the customer has provided you with their firm you need to check if the firm meets HSBC criteria.

| Mortgage amount | No of partners in the firm | Regulation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| £1 < £350k | 1 or more | The firm must be registered with one of the following: Solicitors Regulation Authority (and must be accredited to The Law Society's Conveyancing Quality Scheme) or The Law Society of Scotland or The Law Society of Northern Ireland or the Council for Licenced Conveyancers. All firms must have a minimum professional indemnity insurance cover of £2 million and for lending over £2 million, they must have professional indemnity insurance of £5 million.<br><br>England & Wales:<br><br>Solicitors Regulation Authority regulated firms must be Conveyancing Quality Scheme accredited<br><br>All Council Licensed Conveyancers regulated firms can act for HSBC.<br><br>All Scottish and Northern Ireland regulated firms can act for HSBC |
| £350k < £2m | 2 or more | |
| £2m+ | 4 or more | |

In addition, the firm must be on the approved panel – they must have applied and have been approved by the Bank's panel manager LMS to be able to act for HSBC and the customer on a dual representation basis.

The customer will need to instruct and agree terms with their chosen firm and provide us with the firm's name, address and telephone number.

Customers could provide authority directly should they wish their solicitor to also discuss matters directly with their intermediary.

Please note, sole-practitioner firms are limited to applications up to and including £350,000 mortgage amount.

**Separate legal representation**

If the customer wishes to instruct a solicitor or licensed conveyancer who does not meet the above criteria and is not on the approved panel or is on the approved panel but unable to act due to the mortgage amount, they will still need to provide us with the name, address and telephone number of their chosen firm.

Separate Legal Representation services are capped at a maximum purchase price of £5,000,000 for properties in England, Wales or Scotland or a maximum purchase price of £1,000,000 for properties in Northern Ireland.

Customers could provide authority directly should they wish their solicitor to also discuss matters directly with their intermediary.

We will then instruct a firm via LMS to represent HSBC on a separate representation basis. The bank's separate representation legal firm will liaise directly with the customer's chosen firm but are unable to speak with the customer. For purchase applications, the customer is responsible for paying the costs of the separate representation firm instructed by the bank and the legal work on behalf of HSBC will cost the customer £295 including VAT, in addition to their solicitor's or licenced conveyancer's fees.

This applies regardless of whether the customers appointed solicitor/licensed conveyancer is CQS, CLC accredited, regulated by The Law Society of Scotland or The Law Society of Northern Ireland or no accreditation

Note: firms approved to act on a dual representation basis must not arrange separate representation on HSBC's behalf in any circumstances. HSBC does not instruct conveyancers on the dual representation approved panel to act on its behalf in relation to any separate representation matter.

Where a customer has chosen to instruct their own solicitor on a remortgage or unencumbered lending application, their solicitor must be on the approved panel and be able to act for the mortgage amount as separate legal representation is not an option.

### Remortgage & Unencumbered Loan applications

**Solicitors for Remortgages**

Customers have 2 options -

**1 – Choose a bank appointed panel Solicitor where the standard legal fees are covered by HSBC (Fees Assisted Remortgage); or**

**2 – Customer appoints their own Solicitor or licenced conveyancer – to act for both themselves and HSBC as long as they meet our criteria (see below). The customer will pay all the legal fees for this (Cashback Remortgage)**

Please note that if you chose to change the option, at any time during the application, you would also need to select a current rate to match the incentive chosen (for example if you chose to change from a Fees Assisted Remortgage to a Cashback Remortgage, you would also need to select a current Cashback rate).

Where a Power of Attorney is in place where they will be required to sign documents on behalf of the customer(s), please contact HSBC UK direct to submit an application.

**1 – Choose a bank appointed panel Solicitor where the standard legal fees are covered by HSBC (Fees Assisted Remortgage)**

In order to qualify for this option, you must confirm that your customer's existing lender/lending:

* Originates from a UK based branch/office
* Is a bank/lender registered with FCA/PRA
* The bank account has a UK based sort code and account number
* The mortgage and redemption figure is quoted in UK sterling
* The funds are not to be sent overseas.

Applications where the property has an external wall system (often generically termed "cladding") that requires remediation under the Building Safety Act 2022 (including developer schemes) are excluded from this option.

Applications where there is a requirement to split or merge property titles are outside the scope of this option, this must be completed before the application is submitted.

We will appoint a solicitor or licensed conveyancer to act on our behalf and pay for the standard legal work undertaken by them, the firm will be from the LMS panel or Optima Legal. The customer may need to pay some legal fees themselves in certain circumstances. For example, if they want to add or remove someone from the mortgage. A full breakdown of costs will be provided by the solicitor or licensed conveyancer in advance.

Customers requiring a lease extension are unable to do this under the HSBC UK fees assisted incentive. The customer will instead need to select a cashback rate and instruct their own Solicitor / Conveyancer.

| What's included in the standard costs (paid by HSBC) | Examples of what's not included (additional fees will apply) |
| --- | --- |
| Legal processing fee<br><br>Search and Land registry fees<br><br>Telegraphic Transfer fee to repay your previous lender | Transfer of Title<br><br>Leasehold conveyancing<br><br>Land registry amendments<br><br>Shared ownership – purchase of final Share<br><br>*This list is not exhaustive and a full breakdown of costs will be provided by the solicitor or licensed conveyancer in advance. |

We will notify you which firm has been allocated to the remortgage or unencumbered application. LMS panel and Optima Legal only represent the bank when undertaking the legal processing, undertaking all required searches, liaising with the customer for completion of the security documentation, redeeming the existing lender on a remortgage and registering the charge.

Where there is a need for additional legal work, such as a Transfer of Title, linked to the remortgage application, the customer will need their own legal representation. The customer can choose to either:

* Also appoint the allocated LMS panel firm or Optima Legal to act on their behalf for the additional legal work. For details of the legal fee and other disbursements which may be applicable, please see [Additional Fees](https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/resources/) for details.
* Please see Appointing a Solicitor/Conveyancer for more details on separate legal representation.

Below is a list of the most common types of additional legal work:

* Transfer of title
* Purchase of freehold interest
* Purchase of a final share - please note the application needs to be keyed as 2 separate loans, one for the existing mortgage and one for the new moneys to buy the final share.

**2 – Customer appoints their own Solicitor or licenced conveyancer – to act for both themselves and HSBC as long as they meet our criteria (see below). The customer will pay all the legal fees for this (Cashback Remortgage)**

Under this option, the customer will need to instruct their own solicitor who must be on the approved panel and be able to act for the mortgage amount. The customer must agree costs and terms direct with their chosen firm and is responsible for paying all the legals costs. HSBC will not contribute towards the cost of their legal fees. Separate legal representation is not an option. Please see Appointing a Solicitor/Conveyancer for more details on our criteria.

For more information about the types of documents we accept, see [Verifying a customer's address](https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/resources/) (PDF, 1.3MB).

### Proof of Identity

When you submit an application online, we automatically run an electronic identity check. If the customer's identity cannot be verified electronically, we'll accept a **valid full or provisional UK photo card driving license**, this can be used to both identify themselves and verify their address.

If a customer does not have a valid full UK photo card driving licence, we'll ask for one of the following documents. A separate document will be required to verify proof of address.

Non-certified scanned documents for identification are accepted for business submitted through our broker platform.

#### Preferred Forms of Identification

* Signed Passport
* UK Driving license (full or provisional photo card)
* National Identity Card (EEA and Swiss Nationals only with the exclusion of Romanian and Greek National ID Cards)

#### Alternative Forms of Identification

If the applicant doesn't have any of the above documents, we can accept one of the following:

* Benefits Agency Letter
* Foreign and Commonwealth Office letter (foreign diplomatic staff only)
* HMRC Tax Notification (PAYE coding notice, HMRC Notification of Working Family Tax Credit, HMRC Notification of Children's Tax Credit, HMRC Notification of Disabled Persons Tax Credit or HMRC Tax Calculation)
* Northern Ireland Voter's Card
* Armed forces Identity card
* Group Identification form

For more information about the types of documents we accept, see [Verifying a customer's identity](https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/resources/) (PDF, 1.6MB).

### Post Approval Changes

Where an application has been approved and completion is imminent, if an amendment to the lending is requested, you must ensure any acting Solicitors / Conveyancers are informed of the change.

### Self-Employed Customers

For more information, please refer to the Residential lending criteria section.

#### Self-Employed Documentation Requirements

The following table outlines the evidential documents required for different self-employed scenarios:

**Sole Traders/Partnerships (including LLP with fewer than 200 partners):**

* Last two years' tax calculations (SA302) and corresponding tax year overviews dated within the last 18 months
* Additional information (i.e. business bank statements, further HMRC documentation) may be required by the underwriter to support the application

**Limited Companies:**

* Latest two years' finalised financial accounts (dated within the last 18 months)
* Latest three months' business bank statements or personal account statements if used for business purposes (the most recent statement must be dated within the last 35 days and should show the monthly summary)
* If there are multiple directors within the business, and the financial accounts do not confirm the distribution of salary to each director, then evidence will be required from either the latest two year's P60 or latest two year's Tax Calculation and corresponding Tax Year Overview
* As part of our Underwriting checks, we will validate the information provided by undertaking a check on Companies House. As such there is no longer a requirement for all accounts to be signed

**Note:** A Companies House search will not be available for International customers who provide financial accounts for a Limited Company based overseas, therefore the finalised financial accounts must be signed by an accountant to meet our self-employed policy.

**Sub-Contractors (SC) including Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) Contractors and individuals working for an Umbrella Company:**

* Contractors who will pay their own tax will be treated as Self-Employed. We will classify applicants that pay tax at source but do not receive p60s as they submit tax returns as self employed.
* Sole Traders/Partnerships: Refer to the evidential documentation requirements for Sole Traders/Partnerships (including LLP with fewer than 200 partners)
* Limited Companies: Refer to the evidential documentation requirements for Limited Companies

**Foster Carers:**

* Foster Carers Income will be treated as self-employed income as per HMRC guidance. We will consider the average income over the last two years, however if the latest year is lower than the average then the latest year's figure will be used.
* A letter from the foster agency confirming the total foster income received for each of the last two years as at the point of application
* In addition to the above we will also need to be advised of:
  * The number of foster children currently in the applicant's care
  * If there are any known or foreseeable changes in the level of foster care income

For detailed requirements for specific scenarios (e.g., changing employment status, LLP partnerships, etc.), please refer to the [Residential Evidential Documents Matrix](https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/resources/) or the [Self employed](https://intermediaries.hsbc.co.uk/resources/) policy document.
