### **Additional Borrowing – Buy to Let**

Existing **Buy to Let mortgage customers** must always be treated as a **new lending proposition**.
They are assessed and underwritten based on the **aggregate borrowing / overall exposure**.
The applicant must always complete the appropriate application and detail the **purpose of the borrowing**.

**Requirements:**

* The **main account** must have been running for a **minimum of 6 months** before a further advance will be considered, and at least **6 months must have passed since the last advance date**.
* The **term of the further advance** must be **less than or equal to** the term outstanding on the main mortgage account (maximum term: **35 years** for *Interest Only* or **25 years** for *Repayment / Part and Part* from origination of the main mortgage).
* All existing **group mortgage accounts** (both Buy to Let and Residential) must be **up to date and well conducted**.
* **Joint Mortgage Applications:** Where additional borrowing exceeds **£50,000** and is **wholly for the benefit of only one party** (e.g. purchase of a second Buy to Let property to be registered in one name), **Independent Legal Advice** must be obtained by all other borrower(s) not directly benefiting before any funds are released.

For further information, details of products, and fees payable, please contact our **Intermediary Mortgage Experts Centre** on **0345 073 3330** (Monday to Friday, 9am – 5pm).

### **Adverse Credit History – Buy to Let**

#### **County Court Judgements (CCJs) / Defaults**

Adverse credit, as detailed below, must be **declined**:

* Any **unsatisfied CCJ**
* More than **one satisfied CCJ** where the latest is registered within the past **3 years**
* **Satisfied CCJs** totalling in three locations more than **£200**, where the latest is registered within the past **3 years**
* More than **3 satisfied defaults*** where the latest is registered within the past **3 years**
* **Satisfied defaults*** totalling in three locations more than **£200**, where the latest is registered within the past **3 years**
* Any **outstanding default**, irrespective of amount
* Where a **Limited Company** in which an applicant holds **>15% shareholding** has any **outstanding judgements** totalling more than **£5,000**

* *Includes partially settled defaults which will be referred out to confirm whether full and final settlement has been made.*

Applications can be considered where the above is identified **only if** **documentary evidence of a settled dispute** has been provided by the customer.

---

#### **Bankruptcy / Debt Relief Orders / IVAs**

Lending to a customer with a history of **bankruptcy**, or who has been the subject of a **Debt Relief Order (DRO)** or an **Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)**, can be considered **provided**:

* The bankruptcy, DRO, or IVA was **registered more than 6 years prior** to the date of submission; and
* It **no longer appears** on the credit reference bureau report.

It is **not acceptable** to lend if any applicant is **currently bankrupt** or subject to a **DRO or IVA**.

---

#### **Payment Arrears / Missed Payments**

Adverse credit identified as below must be **declined**:

* **Arrears of 2 or more months** on any one account within the **past 6 months**

**Payment arrangements:**
If payment arrangements appear on the credit search and are **still active** or **ended less than 1 year** prior to application, the case must be **declined**.

---

#### **Mortgage or Rent Arrears**

* If arrears of **more than 1 month** have occurred in the **past 6 months**, or
* **3 months’ arrears** have occurred in the **past 2 years**,

the case is **outside lending policy** and must be **declined**.

However, exceptions may be made where there is an acceptable **technical reason** or **evidence of a settled dispute** verified by the lender.

If this applies, please contact the **Intermediary Mortgage Experts** on **0345 073 3330** (Monday to Friday, 9am – 5pm).

Any applicant known to have had a **mortgaged property repossessed** should normally be **declined**.
However, where historic, underwriters may **consider** such cases, provided a **clear rationale** supports the lending decision.

---

#### **Bankruptcy / IVA (reiterated)**

It is not acceptable to lend where any applicant is **currently bankrupt** or subject to a **Debt Relief Order (DRO)** and/or **Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)**.
However, lending can be considered **if** the bankruptcy, DRO or IVA was **registered more than 6 years ago** from application and no longer appears on the credit reference bureau record.

### **Affordability – Buy to Let**

Barclays uses one of **two methods** to calculate affordability.

Applications that meet the following criteria are initially assessed using an **Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR):**

* Applicant **currently owns or part owns** a UK residential owner-occupied property
* **Loan amount ≤ £1.1m**
* Applicant **is not a portfolio landlord** (holds fewer than 4 BTL mortgages upon completion)
* **Rental income** from background properties covers the **mortgage payments at 100%**

The required cover depends on the applicant’s **income tax band**.
The **gross rental income**, confirmed by the valuer, must cover a **stressed monthly mortgage interest payment** by at least:

* **Basic Rate Taxpayers:** 125%
* **Higher Rate Taxpayers:** 145%
* **Additional Rate Taxpayers:** 150%

The **tax band** should account for **gross rental income across all properties** owned upon completion.

For **Limited Company Directors**, use the **highest tax band payable** to ensure all income is included.
For more information on income tax bands, visit [www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates).

---

If the application does **not meet ICR eligibility**, applicants must pass a **full personal solvency and affordability assessment**.
This includes consideration of:

* Earned and rental income
* Income tax liability (including BTL mortgage interest relief)
* Credit commitments (including residential mortgage payments)
* Existing and applied-for BTL mortgage payments
* Other property-related costs
* Essential expenditure and living costs

You should check affordability **before submitting a case** using the **BTL affordability calculator**.

**MAX system requirements:**
All outstanding **residential** and/or **Buy to Let mortgages** must be declared in MAX.
A maximum of **four applicants** can be assessed if affordability testing is required, although only the **two highest incomes** will be considered.

> **Note:** For further advance borrowing, apply the affordability rate current at the time of assessment to the total borrowing after accounting for any increase in lending.

**BTL applications in a sole name** which fail solvency may still be considered where a **joint residential mortgage** with Barclays exists and shows **no arrears history**.

---

### **Age / Term**

* **Minimum age:** 18 years
* The mortgage term must **not extend beyond age 80** of any applicant

Where the term extends into retirement or the applicant is retired at submission, this is acceptable under standard BTL lending policy **provided**:

* The **principal applicant** meets **minimum income requirements**
* The principal applicant receives **income from an acceptable source** (see *Allowable Gross Income* section)
* The **term** does not extend beyond age 80 of any applicant
* **Maximum term:** 35 years (Interest Only) or 25 years (Repayment or Part & Part) from origination of main mortgage

---

### **Aggregate Borrowing / Overall Exposure**

* **Maximum aggregate borrowing** across all **Barclays BTLs:** £3 million
* **Maximum total Buy to Let borrowing** (Barclays + other lenders): **£4.5 million**
* **Maximum number of mortgaged BTL/PTL properties:**

  * Up to **6 with Barclays**
  * Up to **10 in total** across all lenders (including Barclays)

This includes the **subject (applied-for) property**.

> Landlords with **4 or more mortgaged rental properties** (across all lenders, including the new application) are classified as **Portfolio Landlords**.

---

### **Allowable Gross Income**

Applicants must have a **minimum gross annual income of £25,000**.
For **joint applications**, at least one applicant must earn **£25,000**.

For **individual loans above £1 million**, a minimum **personal/earned income of £75,000 per annum** is required.
For **joint applications**, the **two main applicants** must earn at least **£100,000 combined**, where neither individually earns £75,000.

**Gross income** may include:

* Current basic annual salary
* Monthly bonus / commission / overtime
* Mortgage subsidy
* Car, shift, and large town allowance
* Private, company, or state pension
* Unearned income from trust funds / investments
* Certain disability allowances
* Income from self-employment (*rental income from property portfolios cannot be used*)
* Child Benefit

This applies to both **personal covenant** and **personal solvency assessment**.
All applicants must declare allowable income from all sources and provide **sufficient evidence** to support the lending proposition when requested.

* **Portfolio Landlords:**
  Borrowers with **four or more mortgaged BTL properties**, whether held together or separately, in aggregate.

---

## **Bonus, Overtime or Commission (BTL)**

---

### **Documentation Requirements**

* **Monthly Bonus:**
  3 latest payslips showing bonus amounts received.
  (Bonus must appear on 3 of 3 monthly payslips, or at least 1 of 5 weekly payslips / 3 of 13 weekly payslips.)

* **Monthly Overtime or Commission:**
  3 latest payslips showing at least 1 payment.

A **P60** is required where **more than 50%** of the most recent **3-month average** is needed to meet affordability.

---

### **Monthly Bonus**

1. Confirm if the **monthly bonus** is shown on the **most recent 3 months’ payslips**.
2. We will **never use less than 50%** of the 3-month average.
3. **Average** the total bonus from the last 3 payslips and **compare** the annualised figure to the P60.
4. Deduct salary, allowances, and any bonuses paid less frequently than monthly when reviewing the P60.
5. Divide the remaining figure by 12 to find the **P60 monthly average**.
6. Use the **lower** of the following (unless minimum 50% applies):

   * 100% of the 3-month average, or
   * 100% of the latest P60 monthly average.

> *If pay frequency is not monthly (e.g. bi-weekly, 4-weekly, or weekly), refer to the “Weekly, 2-Weekly or 4-Weekly” section below.*

---

### **Annual Bonus**

* Use the **gross (pre-tax) bonus figure**.
* Bonuses paid **less frequently than monthly** are classed as **annual**.
* Bonuses paid **monthly or more frequently** are classed as **monthly** (see Monthly Bonus section).

> **Note:** The customer is not required to have been with the same employer for 2 years, but the most recent annual bonus must have been paid by their current employer within the **last 12 months**.
> An annual bonus can be considered if it has only been paid in the most recent year.

---

### **Payslip Requirements**

Number of payslips required depends on **bonus frequency**:

* **Quarterly bonus:** 8 payslips showing bonus payments.
* **Half-yearly bonus:** 4 payslips showing bonus payments.
* **Annual bonus:** 2 payslips showing bonus payments.

> *Payslips can evidence annual bonuses over 2 years (P60s not required for validation).*

---

### **P60s**

Where payslips cannot be provided, confirm sustainability using the **last 2 years’ P60s**.

* P60s are only acceptable where the customer is **not also receiving regular bonus, overtime, or commission**.
* Use P60s to confirm bonuses over the last 2 years.
* Calculate the annual bonus for both years.
* If the latest year’s bonus is **lower**, use the latest figure.
* If **higher**, use the average of both years.

---

### **Calculate Overtime or Commission**

1. Identify if overtime/commission appears on at least **1 of the most recent 3 payslips**.
2. Average the total from the 3 payslips and compare the annualised figure to the P60.
3. Deduct salary, allowances, and infrequent bonuses when reviewing the P60.
4. Divide the remaining figure by 12 to find the **P60 monthly average**.
5. Use the **lower** of the following (unless 50% minimum applies):

   * 100% of the 3-month average
   * 100% of the latest P60 monthly average

> *If pay frequency is not monthly (e.g. bi-weekly / 4-weekly / weekly), see “Weekly, 2-Weekly or 4-Weekly” section below.*

---

### **Examples**

***Example 1 (3 consecutive most recent payslips)***

* Basic = £20,000
* Monthly bonus (average over 3 months) = £1,000
* P60 total income = £23,000
* Bonus (P60 value) = £3,000 ÷ 12 = £250 per month
* **Monthly bonus figure to use = £500 per month**

**Decision:**
As the P60 monthly average (after basic salary) is **less than 50%** of the 3-month average, the figure used is **£500 per month** (50% × £1,000).

---

***Example 2 (bonus evidenced on at least 1 of 3 recent payslips)***

* Basic annual income = £20,000
* Monthly overtime (average over 3 months) = £1,000/month
* P60 total income = £29,000
* Overtime (P60 value) = £9,000 ÷ 12 = £750/month
* **Overtime figure to use = £750 per month**

**Decision:**
As the P60 monthly average is **lower than 100%** of the 3-month average, use **£750 per month** (lower of the two averages).

---

***Example 3 (commission evidenced on at least 1 of 3 payslips)***

* Basic annual income = £20,000
* Commission (average over 3 months) = £1,000/month
* P60 total = £38,000
* Commission (P60 value) = £18,000 ÷ 12 = £1,500/month
* **Commission figure to use = £1,000 per month**

**Decision:**
As the P60 monthly average is **higher than 100%** of the 3-month average, use **£1,000 per month** (lower of the two).

### **If Income Frequency Is Not Monthly**

| **If Income** | **Then**                                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monthly**   | Use latest month’s payslip figure.                                                                                        |
| **4-Weekly**  | Use latest 4-weekly payslip. Multiply by 13 (annual figure). Divide by 12 (monthly equivalent).                           |
| **2-Weekly**  | Add last 3 payslips. Divide by 6 (average weekly pay). Multiply by 52 (annual figure). Divide by 12 (monthly equivalent). |
| **Weekly**    | Add last 5 payslips. Divide by 5 (average weekly pay). Multiply by 52 (annual figure). Divide by 12 (monthly equivalent). |

---

### **Business-Related Lending**

Applications from clients wishing to **purchase properties in their personal name from a Limited Company** in which they have a controlling interest are **outside Barclays’ standard lending criteria**.

---

### **Cladding / The Building Safety Act 2022 – Buy to Let**

* The **Building Safety Act 2022** protects leaseholders from remediation costs for external combustible materials where an agreed remediation plan exists.
* Buildings with external wall systems may require an **EWS1 rating**.

  * **A3 or B2** ratings indicate remediation is required.
* Barclays supports applications for affected properties where there is a **qualifying lease or recognised remediation plan** in place.

**Evidence required (one of the following):**

* Written confirmation from a **developer** (who has signed a Government contract).
* A **Building Safety Act 2022 Leaseholder Deed of Certificate** and corresponding **Landlord Certificate**.
* Written confirmation from a **housing association** confirming remediation, or a **DLUHC** letter confirming government funding approval.

Where Landlord and Leaseholder certificates are provided, capture any **financial liability** shown in the “Work undertaken on relevant defects” section.

> Any client contribution is spread over **10 years (120 months)** and must be included within the **service charge** for affordability.

Properties remediated by developers or housing associations (no leaseholder liability) **do not impact affordability**.

> Applications for properties requiring remediation will only proceed if satisfactory evidence is provided as per the above.
> Barclays can support rate switches, permission-to-let requests, or tenure conversions (BTL ↔ residential) **without remediation evidence**.
> For any **additional borrowing**, these rules apply.

---

### **Commitments – Buy to Let**

BTL affordability assessments follow ICR criteria as outlined under *Affordability – Buy to Let*.

Commitments considered include:

* Hire Purchase Agreements, Mail Order, Bank or Finance Loans, Payday Loans, or Second Charges.
* Deferred or future commitments (e.g. shared equity fees, deferred payments).
* Regular Pension Payments (excluding one-off contributions).
* Court Orders or Judgement Debts.
* CSA/Child Maintenance payments.
* School fees and childcare/nursery costs.
* Student loan repayments.
* Ground rent, service charges, maintenance charges.
* Credit card debt (3% of balance).
* Overdrafts (3% of drawn balance).
* Council Tax.
* Shared Equity Loans.
* Other regular commitments (excluding living costs).
* **Foreign Credit Commitments:** Converted to GBP using the [Barclays Foreign Note Rate](https://www.barclays.co.uk/travel/foreign-currency-exchange/) on the date of decision (DIP1).

**Other considerations:**

* Debts with <6 months remaining may be ignored if total ≤ £1,000.
* Outstanding payday loans must be deducted from net income.
* Commitments repaid by the new mortgage may be ignored (subject to offer condition).

---

### **Contract Workers – Buy to Let**

Policy depends on whether the applicant works on an **employed** or **self-employed** basis.

**Employed contractors (e.g. Junior Doctors, Teachers, Junior Solicitors)**
→ Keyed as *Employed*, since contracts roll over with continuous employment.

#### **All Contractors**

* No more than a **6-week gap** between contracts.
* **12 months of contracts** required (minimum 2 contracts if latest <12 months).
* If recently moved from employment to contracting with previous employer:

  * Must show 3 years of prior employment and provide the service contract (terms, pay, and duration).
* Must have **3 months remaining** on current contract or evidence of renewal.

## O-Q

* Minimum age of the principal applicant is to be 18 or over
* A personal affordability check for all applicants is required when we cannot assess rental calculations
* Sole applicants must earn a minimum gross income of £25,000 (for joint applications at least one applicant must earn £25,000)
* Minimum gross annual personal/earned income for individual loans above £1m is £75,000 (for joint applications, the two primary applicants must earn at least £100,000 between them if neither applicant earns £75,000)

* Self employed applicants must have been trading in their current business for a minimum of 2 years

* Note: Each application will be assessed on its own merits; our underwriters need to be comfortable with the application and the proposed BTL security

### Porting – Buy to Let

All BTL loan products are fully portable, subject to the new mortgage meeting our policy.
Porting allows mortgage customers to carry forward the existing mortgage product to a new mortgage. There are circumstances where the porting is dependent on the jurisdiction of the customers residence. New Buy to Let mortgage products are not portable. The value of the ported element of the new mortgage must be at least 75% the amount outstanding on the product being ported, to avoid Early Repayment Charge.

### Property concentration

In order for Barclays to proactively manage the risk of over exposure in one location (i.e. on a particular development/estate, in an individual block, in the same road/street) an assessment of the property concentration we currently hold, will be carried out by our BTL Mortgage Processing Centre on receipt of the application based upon postcode concentration.
The maximum Barclays property concentration is 6 properties in any one postcode (eg AB1 2CD), the only exception is where there is high volumes of flats we will accept up to 10% of properties. Although all applications where there are more than 4 properties in any one postcode will be referred for review.

### Property location

BTL properties must be located in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.

### Property management

We recommend that a reputable qualified letting agent should be engaged to let and manage a BTL property. However, where a client can demonstrate relevant experience we'll allow them to undertake their own letting and management.

### Property types - Buy to Let

**There are some property types which are not deemed suitable security for the Barclays Group and so in all cases lending will be declined on Buy to Let properties. These scenarios are listed below:**
* Demolish and rebuilds
* Freehold flats and maisonettes (Scottish flats that are held in Absolute Ownership (former feu) are acceptable as long as a Deed of Conditions has been created to regulate the management and maintenance of the property as a whole.)
* Properties classed as ‘houses in multiple occupation’ where a licence from the Local Authority is required
* Live-work units
* Easiform cavity walled concrete
* Those where the client uses or proposes to use any part or whole of the security offered for owner occupation
* Those with multiple tenancy or licence agreements in place.
* Those that contain bed-sits.
* Flats that are not self-contained or without independent access
* Any property not recommended as suitable security by our surveyor or which falls outside our Lending Policy.
* Adjoining flats (granny annexe)
* Where there are any Agricultural Restrictions
* Mixed-use properties
* Section 106 properties

**Some properties may have certain features which mean that extra care will have to be taken. In these cases please contact the Intermediary Support Team for further details on our lending policy:**
* Japanese Knotweed – Japanese Knotweed would be assessed by a valuer following [RICS guidance](https://www.rics.org/content/dam/ricsglobal/documents/standards/Japanese%20knotweed_October%202022.pdf). If an invasive weed outbreak is present, it must be treated. The treatment should be carried out by a reputable contractor who is part of a registered body. Payment must be made in full upfront, or funds should be held back until completion. Additionally, a valid insurance-backed, transferable 10-year guarantee must be in place upon completion. This guarantee is required before or at the commencement of treatment.
* Properties with deck area access can only be considered for good quality developments with no restriction whatsoever on mortgageability/saleability.
* Contaminated land – Typically from previous industrial use of the site
* High-rise blocks of flats – properties with deck area access or properties that have non-decorative timber cladding will be looked at individually
* Modern methods of construction – Will require an individual assessment by a valuer
* Early steel frame construction - Will require an individual assessment by a valuer

The above lists are not exhaustive; please call our Intermediary Mortgage Experts on 0345 073 3330 - Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm for further details.

### Reduced income for defined period of time and parental leave

When an applicant is currently on, or is about to start, a period of reduced income for a defined period of time (e.g. maternity paternity, adoption leave), we’ll base the affordability and overall lending assessment on their ‘return to work’ income details.
To verify their income, please provide all of the following
* Their latest payslip
* Their last payslip before the period of reduced income, if they’ve already started a period of reduced income
* Their return-to-work details. As a minimum, this must include
* Intended return date
* Proposed basic income on return
* If the applicant is working hourly, the proposed number of hours to be worked on their return
* If the applicant intends to amend their working hours, confirmation that their employer has approved this

### Remortgages (including capital raising)

Re-mortgages must always be treated as a new lending proposition and assessed and underwritten on the basis of the aggregate borrowing/overall exposure and in accordance with BTL Lending Policy.
**In ALL cases:**
* Refer to Basic Lending Terms for maximum loan to value, minimum interest cover, maximum individual loan amount, maximum aggregate exposure and LTV/property restrictions per customer
* The applicant must have owned the property for a minimum of 6 months before a re-mortgage will be considered
* Lending on new build properties, including newly converted properties (first registration of the property was 2 or fewer years ago) is restricted to £500k for up to 75% LTV and £1m for 60% LTV and below.
* The applicant must always complete the appropriate application/online submission and detail the purpose of any capital raising required
* Supporting documents must be provided as detailed in the Requirements Table

**Re-mortgages with capital raising:**
Any re-mortgage must meet our minimum mortgage amount of £35,000, subject to product availability. It is acceptable for the capital raising element to be used for the following purposes only:
* To assist with the purchase of a further residential property (ie, BTL or residential property)
* To buy out the equity interest from associated parties
* For property repairs or improvements to any residential property owned
* To assist with financing changes in our security, eg, purchase of additional land that will form part of our security, purchase of freehold, extension of lease
* To repay existing residential mortgage
On joint mortgage applications where there is any additional borrowing or equity release in excess of £50,000 and this is to be for the benefit of one party to the mortgage only (eg purchase of a second/BTL property to be registered in the name of one party), Independent Legal Advice must be obtained by all other borrowers not directly benefiting before any funds are released.

### Repayment types

BTL loans can be taken on the basis of:
* Capital repayment (capital & interest)
* Interest-only or
* A mixture of both

### Residency - Buy to Let

Residency criteria for BTL differs to that of residential mortgages as the property won't be occupied by the client. The definitions, for BTL purposes, of a UK resident, a Non-UK resident, and expatriate are detailed below:

**UK Resident** - Someone who is resident in the UK at the time of application

**Non-UK Resident** - Someone who is not resident in the UK at the time of application
**Applicant with Permanent Rights To Reside in the UK with 2+ years UK residency** – Acceptable for Buy to Let lending purposes
**Applicant with Permanent Rights to Reside in the UK with less than 2 years UK residency** – Acceptable for Buy to Let lending purposes (subject to additional criteria)
**Applicant without Permanent Rights To Reside in the UK with 2+ years UK residency** - Acceptable for Buy to Let lending purposes up to 65% LTV (subject to additional criteria)
**Applicant without Permanent Rights to Reside in the UK with less than 2 years residency** – Not Acceptable for Buy to Let lending purposes

*PRR in this context includes applicants with any of the following: Settled status (EU, EEA and Swiss nationals), Indefinite leave to remain, British citizenship (including dual citizenship where applicant is a British citizen and a citizen of another country), Irish (RoI) citizenship.
† Applicants that do not have PRR but have resided in the UK for at least 2 years can be considered, however, the following additional criteria applies where that applicant’s income is required for affordability purposes:
• The maximum LTV is 65%
• The applicant must have at least 1 year remaining on their visa
• The following documentation is required:

* For employed applicants:
  3 months’ bank statements AND 3 months’ payslips are required, showing mandated salary paid in the UK to the applicant’s own bank account. Where an applicant has travelled from another country to work in the UK, to be paid in cash this is unacceptable.
* For new to bank customers:
  ID for KYC purposes must be verified by a Passport (not a UK travel document or driving licence).
* For purchase applications:
  The source of funds being used in the transaction (including deposit and SDLT) must be evidenced.

‡ Applicants with PRR that have resided in the UK for less than 2 years can be considered, however, the following additional criteria applies where that applicant’s income is required for affordability purposes:
• Self-employed income cannot be considered
• The following documentation is required:

* 3 months’ bank statements
* 3 month’s payslips are required, showing salary paid in the UK via a mandated salary to the applicant’s own bank account. (Where a professional has travelled from another continent to work in the UK, it is unacceptable to be paid in cash)
* ID for KYC purposes must be verified by a Passport (not UK travel documents or driving licences), which all applicants would hold
* For purchase applications:
  The source of funds being used in the transaction (including deposit and SDLT) must be evidenced.

We currently only accept applications from non-UK residents for existing BTL mortgage holders through Barclays Wealth International. Please contact them on 0207 574 3017 for further information.

### Second/subsequent charges

When a second/subsequent charge is secured against the subject property, you should provide us with the following information:
* Second/subsequent chargee name
* Second/subsequent chargee address
* Account/reference number
* Confirmation of whether the charge will be repaid with the proceeds of the mortgage
If there is a cost to the applicant associated with the charge (for example, it relates to a secured loan) this must also be recorded in the application as a commitment.
We will require a Deed of Postponement (DoP) prior to release of funds.

### Self-employed

Applicants are classed as self-employed when they hold over a 20% share in a company.
For details of documentary requirements for self-employed, please see [Criteria and Packaging Guide](https://intermediaries.uk.barclays/content/dam/intermediaries-uk-barclays/pdf/Criteria_and_Packaging_Guide.pdf "Opens in a new window") [PDF, 757KB].

**PAT (Profit after tax)**
Profit, after any applicable corporation tax has been deducted, can be considered towards the affordability assessment, in addition to the applicant’s director’s salary where applicable, where the following requirements are met:
* The Loan amount (less capitalised product fees) is Over or equal to £1m. (Where the loan amount is below £1m the affordability assessment will be based on the applicant’s director’s salary and dividends only. PAT cannot be taken into consideration.
* The borrower(s) collectively own greater than 50% of the company’s shares.

The maximum amount of Limited Company PAT that can be considered as part of the overall affordability assessment is the lower of:
* 50% of the three-year average Limited Company PAT, or
* 50% of the Limited Company PAT for the latest trading year.

The amount of PAT used will be determined by the percentage shareholding of the applicant. E.g. where the borrower is a 70% shareholder a maximum 35% of PAT can be considered (50% of 70%).
The Maximum amount of PAT used towards affordability cannot exceed 5x the average {Salary + Dividends} paid to the applicant(s) over 2 most recent years, as evidenced by the 2 latest tax calculations.
Where more than 25% of the company’s trading income is received in a currency other than GBP the maximum amount of PAT that can be used towards affordability reduces to 40% (further reduced where the applicants’ combined shareholding is less than 100%, as described above).
Applicants that have received a loan from the company that remains outstanding at the point of application would require the amount they are repaying each month to be captured as a commitment within the affordability assessment as 1/12 of the outstanding amount (as evidenced by an accountant's letter). Detail needed for accountants' letter can be found in 'Useful documents' under 'Limited Company Profit After Tax'.

### Solicitors

We'll accept solicitors to act on behalf of Barclays if nominated from the Barclays panel. The Barclays reserves the right to nominate/appoint solicitors to act on its behalf, the costs of which must be covered by the applicant.

### Valuations – Buy to Let

To be able to lend on a property, Barclays requires a valuation to be carried out.
When you apply for a Barclays mortgage, the valuation type depends on whether your mortgage will be on a residential or Buy to Let basis.

The mortgage valuation is our standard report for all residential applications and includes:
* A description of the property
* An opinion of the market value of the property as at the date of inspection
* An estimate of the current cost to reinstate the property in its present form (where appropriate)

It’s important to remember that the mortgage valuation is a report primarily for Barclays’ purposes and confirms whether the property is suitable security for a mortgage – it is not a survey.

We recommend that all clients consider instructing a separate survey to obtain a more detailed assessment of the property’s condition.

Your client may wish to contact:
* Countrywide Surveying Services on 0800 012 6995*
* e.surv on 0800 169 9661*
* or any other provider

to discuss the different survey options available. More information on survey types can be found in the ‘Home Surveys’ section of the [Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)](https://www.rics.org/uk/upholding-professional-standards/sector-standards/building-surveying/home-surveys/ "This link opens in a new window") website.

Please note that if your clients do instruct their own survey, this will be a separate contract between them and their chosen survey provider, and separate fees will apply. Barclays will always rely on the mortgage valuation for the purpose of agreeing the mortgage.

### Automated Valuation Model (AVM)

For Buy to Let remortgages and further advances on properties:
* up to £1 million in value (up to £2 million in London and the South East)
* where the loan-to-value (LTV) is 65% or less (subject to product availability),

Barclays uses AVMs to assist with instant mortgage decisions.

Whether you apply through MAX or other online systems (e.g. MTE or Trigold), the use of AVMs will help speed up the decision and offer a better process for your customer.

AVMs are only suitable for further borrowing where the latest valuation was a physical one – i.e. not an AVM.
