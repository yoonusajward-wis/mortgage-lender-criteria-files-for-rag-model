### Using passing rent to calculate the estimated loan amount

• Evidence of two rental periods (defined as two 6 month periods) through either bank statements or confirmation of rent received from an ARLA-registered letting agent.
• The passing rent adopted doesn’t exceed 10% of the market rent supported by the valuer.
• The passing rent is on a fully exclusive basis - it doesn’t include cost of utilities, council tax etc.
• The tenant is an independent third party.

### Valuation & valuation fees

Please see our Valuation fee scale for more information and our approach.

Standard valuation reports are for the sole purpose of enabling Kent Reliance to assess the suitability of the proposed security and to decide on the amounts (if any) that can be advanced on the mortgage, and the report remains the property of Kent Reliance. The valuation fee collected is non-refundable unless explicitly stated on the associated illustration. On submission of an application, you will need to accept the FMA declaration that stipulates this in order to proceed.
