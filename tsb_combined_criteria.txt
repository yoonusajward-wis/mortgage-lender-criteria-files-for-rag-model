## Affordability

**Source:** [Affordability](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/affordability/)

We use affordability as a way of assessing how much we will lend. Please refer to our Affordability Calculator. 

We have a maximum loan to income (LTI) calculation of:

| **Income**                    | **LTV**           | **Income Multiple Mainstream\***                      | **Income Multiple New Build\*** |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| More than £75,000             | <85%              | 5.50 times income                                     | 5.50 times income               |
|                               | \>85%             | 4.49 times income                                     | <90% LTV 5.50 times income >90% LTV 4.49 times income |
| £60,001 - £75,000             | <85%              | 5.00 times income                                     | 5.00 times income               |
|                               | \>85%             | 4.49 times income                                     | 4.49 times income               |
| Less than or equal to £60,000 | <95%              | 4.49 times income                                     | 4.49 times income               |

\* **Where one or more applicants are self employed, the following maximum LTI calculation will be applied:**

| **Income**                    | **LTV**           | **Income Multiple** |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| More than £100,000            | <85%              | 5.50 times income   |
| \>85%                         | 4.49 times income |                     |
| £75,000 - £100,000            | <85%              | 5.00 times income   |
| \>85%                         | 4.49 times income |                     |
| Less than or equal to £74,999 | <95%              | 4.49 times income   |

The amount of income used in the affordability calculation is defined as a percentage for all income types. You'll find more information here 'Treatment of Income'.

A stress rate of 6.75% interest (or product rate +1% if higher) is used for residential lending. This includes First Time Buyer applications. At DIP, a stress rate of 6.75% will initially apply. Then at product selection, if the rate selected is higher, the product rate +1% stress rate will apply at application submission.

## Debt to income

When determining affordability, applications will be declined when the credit score confirms the applicant has:

* Opened three or more accounts e.g. credit card or personal loan in the last six months, OR
* Their unsecured commitment balances have increased by more than 20% in the last three months

AND EITHER:

* The total monthly payments for unsecured commitments are more than 20% of gross monthly income - based on combined unsecured commitments and the amount of income used in affordability for joint applications. OR
* The balance of total unsecured commitments is more than 100% of gross annual income - based on combined unsecured commitments and the amount of income used in affordability for joint applications.

## Commitments and outgoings

As well as considering the applicant's income for affordability, we will also need to consider any regular outgoings that they are committed to.

These include but are not limited to:

### Background Buy-to-Let properties

In Residential affordability calculations, 60% of any surplus rental income from self funding background BTL properties will be included. To be considered as self-funding, 69% of the total rental income must be greater than the total monthly payments of all background BTL mortgaged properties. This is based on interest only at a stressed rate of interest of 5.5%.

### Credit commitments

* Outstanding mortgage balances
* Outstanding credit card balances including mail order, charge cards & store cards
* Hire purchase / Car lease agreements
* Loans including student loans
* Overdrafts
* Buy now pay later loans including short term agreements with online credit providers such as Klarna, Clearpay, Laybuy and Paypal Credit.

### Non-credit commitments

* Ground rent/service charges
* Maintenance
* Child care
* Rental/Tenancy
* School/University fees
* Shared Ownership rent.

### Other costs

These are other commitments which have significant costs and are related to the following:

* Care of a family member not residing in the property, for example care home costs for a parent
* Associated running costs (as a minimum council tax and utility bills) from background properties that are not rented out, regardless of whether the property is mortgaged or mortgage free.
* Other education costs, for example the applicant themselves is studying for a degree
* Significant hobby costs that the applicant is fully committed to and would not want to relinquish, for example stable costs for owning a horse.

These other commitments must be ones that the applicant would be unable or unwilling to give up without a detrimental impact to their family, lifestyle or income.

Non-credit commitments which can be cancelled without a significant impact and have relatively low costs would not need to be keyed.

Pension contributions do not need to be keyed as a commitment.

Significant commuting costs and accommodation away from the home should be captured and considered for affordability. Our affordability model factors in average costs based on ONS data. 

Affordability must also include any known future changes to income and/or commitments. Please refer to Future Changes, for more information on when the known future changes should be reflected within income and/or commitments.

## Background properties owned by the applicant

**Source:** [Background properties owned by the applicant](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/background-properties/)

## Properties that are not rented out

The existing mortgage payment must be keyed as a credit commitment and will be included in the affordability calculation.
It is also essential that the associated running costs from background properties that are not rented out (e.g. second home applications with a residential property in the background or residential application with a second home in the background) are considered in the affordability calculation. To ensure this, associated running costs should be keyed as 'Second Home Running Costs' in Household Expenditure - see Affordability - other costs .

## Existing property to be rented out

- The mortgage property must be keyed into the 'Existing mortgages' screen.
- Customer type must be "borrower with other lender" to enable the new mortgage to be keyed
- If you select 'Yes' to 'Is the property let?', this will allow you to enter monthly rental income.
- If confirmation is required we would request a letter from the letting agent confirming the expected rental income.
- We will also accept a valuation dated in the last 6 months.

## Other Buy-to-Let mortgaged properties owned

Other let properties must be keyed individually in the 'Existing mortgages' section. If you select 'Yes' to 'Is the property let?', this will allow you to enter monthly rental income for each individual property. If confirmation is required we would request one of the following:
- A letter, statement or invoice from the letting agent confirming the rental income.
- Latest 3 months’ consecutive bank statements showing rental income.
- Tenancy agreement (current agreement required, not to be out of date/expired).
- Letter from accountant or solicitor
In order for background BTL properties to be considered as self-funding, 69% of the total rental income will be calculated and must be greater than the total monthly payments of all background BTL mortgaged properties based on interest only at a stressed rate of interest of 5.50%. For example: If a customer has three background BTL mortgage properties, with combined mortgage balances of £235,000 (all remaining outstanding at completion) total rental income must be greater than £1560.99per month i.e. (£235,000 x 5.5% / 12) / 69%.
- Any deficit will be deducted as a commitment within the affordability calculation.
- 60% of any surplus will be included in the affordability calculation.

## Mortgage Free Properties

Where an applicant has BTL properties with no mortgage commitment outstanding, the rental income can be used in affordability calculations if:
- The applicant is declaring the income to the Inland Revenue and can evidence the rental income received by way of their Tax Calculations with corresponding Tax Year Overviews or an Accountants reference.
- Self employed criteria being met i.e. two years' rental income figures being obtained and verified.
If this applies the rental income should be treated as self employed income.
Where an applicant is self employed and their income is solely derived from property letting, please contact TSB for guidance before submitting the application.

## Holiday Lets

Where an applicant has UK holiday lets in the background, the rental income can be used in affordability calculations if:
- The applicant is declaring the income to the Inland Revenue and can evidence the rental income received by way of their Tax Calculations with corresponding Tax Year Overviews or an Accountants reference.
- Self employed criteria being met i.e. two years' rental income figures being obtained and verified.
If this applies the rental income should be treated as self employed income.

## Concessionary Purchase

**Source:** [Concessionary Purchase](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/concessionary-purchase/)

The minimum discount on the purchase price must be either:

* 5% of the market value with a minimum 5% deposit from the applicant.

**Or** 

* 10% of the market value when there is no deposit.

**Please see the table below for acceptable and unacceptable policy scenarios.**

Concessionary purchases can only be agreed for subsequent sales (not new build) up to 100% of the purchase price (subject to normal lending limits) in the following circumstances:

The property purchase is solely for the applicant(s) to live in as their main residence and the applicant is:

* Purchasing from an immediate family member* at a discounted price and the vendor must move out on completion.

**OR**

* A sitting tenant purchasing from their landlord (private or council) at a discounted price. Excludes Right to Buy and Resale Price Covenants. Refer to Right to buy and Occupancy restricted properties for further details.
* To qualify, the tenant must have been subject to a tenancy agreement on the property for a minimum of 1 year.
* For joint applications, at least one client must meet sitting tenant policy.

*The **only** relationships permitted for a concessionary purchase are (including vice versa):

* Parent/Child
* Siblings/Sibling
* Grandparent or great grandparent /grandchild.

These relationships can include adopted, half and step family members.

If there are other parties named on the title, that don't fall under the permitted relationship list. As long as the acceptable party is discounting their share only (and the other party/parties receive the full market value for their share) this is an acceptable concessionary purchase.

All family purchase transactions must provide vacant possession on completion. This must be a genuine discount (must not be subject to any future repayment, clawback or retained interest terms).

**Policy Scenarios**

| **Scenario** | **Deposit** | **Concession** | **Policy** |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1            | 5%          | 5%             | In policy – minimum 5% deposit and concession                                     |

| 6            | 10%         | 30%            | In policy – concession above 10%                                                  |
| 7            | 3%          | 10%            | In policy – concession 10%                                                        |
| 8            | 0%          | 5%             | Not in policy – minimum 5% deposit required when concession is 5%                 |
| 9            | 3%          | 7%             | Not in policy – minimum 5% deposit required when concession is between 5% and 10% |

A valuation must be instructed in all cases including properties in Scotland (retypes are not permitted).

_As the application results can differ on these cases once the correct purchase price has been keyed, you must contact The TSB Intermediary Processing Team for all applications for Concessionary Purchase. This will ensure correct underwriting of the case has been carried out at the time of application._

## Contractors

**Source:** [Contractors](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/contractors/)

## Employment contracts


## Subcontractors, fixed/short term contracts, agency workers and umbrella companies

- The applicant has 12 months contract history (with exception of Junior Doctors where 6 months contract history required), evidencing no gaps exceeding 6 weeks with at least 3 months remaining (if less than 3 months remaining a future contract showing a minimum of 3 months future employment will be required)
- Where contract history is less than 12 months and the applicant is in a Professional occupation a referral can be made to Underwriters for consideration.
- Where a customer has provided 12 month contract history but is now on a rolling contract or the current contract does not evidence an end date more than 3 months in the future, the current employer or agency must provide evidence that the contract is still valid. This letter must be provided directly from the employer/agency and contain: Name of the customer (first name and surname as a minimum). Name of employer or agency Day rate amount Contract remains valid
- Name of the customer (first name and surname as a minimum).
- Name of employer or agency
- Day rate amount
- Contract remains valid
- Name of the customer (first name and surname as a minimum).
- Name of employer or agency
- Day rate amount
- Contract remains valid

## CIS Contractors

- The applicant must have 12 months contract history, evidencing no gaps exceeding 6 weeks with at least 3 months remaining (if less than 3 months remaining a future contract showing a minimum of 3 months future employment will be required).
- Treat as a fixed term contractor where employer deducts full PAYE tax and National Insurance contributions being paid direct to HMRC.
- Treat as self employed where employer does not deduct full PAYE tax and National Insurance contributions.

## Probationary contracts

- If the applicant has started employment within 3 months and is on a probationary contract, select yes to the radio button that populates asking if the customer is in a probation period.
Applicants who have an initial probationary period at the start of their permanent contract are not included in the above and can be treated as permanent.

## Zero hours contracts

Subject to underwriter referral. Each case must be considered on an individual basis and the customer must have a minimum of 12 month contract history, evidencing no gaps exceeding 6 weeks.  Income should be verified by way of the latest P60, the last 3 months payslips (6 if fortnightly, 12 if weekly) and 12 months contract history to show a consistent and sustainable level of income.

## Day Rate Contractors

- Customers must have a minimum income of £50,000 from their average day rate, no other income will count towards the minimum requirement. Bonus, overtime, commission and location/car allowance will not be considered for affordability.
- Customers must have 12 months contract history, evidencing no gaps exceeding 6 weeks with at least 3 months remaining (if less than 3 months remaining a future contract showing a minimum of 3 months future employment will be required). If on a rolling contract the current employer or agency must provide evidence that the contract is still valid.
- To calculate day rate income, multiply average day rate for the last 12 months by 5 (days) and then by 46 (weeks) (including any future contracts if applicable).  If applicant has had 2 contracts in the last 12 months, 1 at £400 per day and 1 at £300 per day then the average day rate would be £350 (£400 + £300 / 2 = £350).  Annual income based on average day rate with this example would be £350 x 5 x 46 which is £80,500.
- You will also need to capture a basic salary which should match the day rate x 5 x 46 unless the customer works anything other than 5 days per week  The lower of the basic salary or day rate captured will be used for affordability.
- If a contract specifies a basic salary / income this should be captured, and if it specifies a set number of days this should be used to calculate the basic salary.  If for example the contract states the customer works 4 days per week and the average day rate is £350 you would multiply £350 x 4 x 46 which is £64,400 per annum.
- Where the customer works a shift pattern the basic salary will need to be calculated manually.  This can be done by dividing the days worked by the sum of days worked minus rest days, then multiplying by 7, multiplying by day rate and then by 46.  Example 12 days on 12 days off would be: 12 / (12+12) = 0.5, then 0.5 x 7 x £350 (as per previous example) x 46 = £56,350.  If you need help working out a basic salary please contact your BDM or our office based BDM team.
- Any additional living costs and travel costs incurred by the customer should be captured as a commitment and keyed as 'other' in household expenditure.
- Where day rate contractor income has been captured the maximum loan to value will be 95%.*
* For Buy To Let applications, the maximum loan to value will be 80%.
- Where day rate contractors are employed via a LTD company, and their ownership share is less than 100% and/or the contract is in the name of the LTD company - self-employed criteria will apply.

## Dependents

**Source:** [Dependents](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/dependents/)

A dependent is anyone who is financially reliant on the applicant and who is not a party to the mortgage. For example, a dependent may be a child, adult or elderly relative. All dependents need to be recorded in the dependents field within Mortgage Pro under applicant 1.
Where a child lives/stays with the applicant(s) part time and maintenance is being paid, the maintenance must be deducted as a commitment and the child needs to be recorded in the dependents field within Mortgage Pro under applicant 1.
Where a child does not live/stay with the applicant(s) and maintenance is being paid, the maintenance must be deducted as a committed expenditure. However, the child does not need to be recorded as a dependent.
Where the applicant(s) has foster children, they should not be keyed as dependents.
Ukraine refugees living in the property should not be keyed as dependents.

## Examples


### Dependent Spouse

If the applicant's spouse/partner is not party to the mortgage and is financially dependent on the applicant, they need to be keyed as a dependent. For example, they are a house person without an employed income.

### Dependent Relatives

Where a relative (e.g. elderly parent) resides at the property and isn't party to the mortgage they need to be keyed as a dependent if they are financially reliant on the applicant.
Where the applicant supports an elderly relative who doesn't reside at the property (e.g. living in a care home) then they would not be keyed as a dependent but the costs instead need be keyed under Committed expenditure.

### Grown up Children Living at Home

Grown up children need to be keyed as dependents where they reside at the property and are financially dependent on the applicant (e.g. they are unemployed or still in full time education). Where the applicant is incurring additional costs due to the child's education (e.g. university fees) these must be keyed separately under Committed expenditure.

## EWS1 Process – Cladding & External Wall System

**Source:** [EWS1 Process – Cladding & External Wall System](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/ews1/)

Where a Valuer has specific concerns with the materials used for the external wall system, they will recommend us to seek confirmation of the fire safety status of the block, in line with the latest RICS guidance.
Below details our cladding policy, in some scenarios an EWS1 form may not be required. In the event none of the scenarios apply, an EWS1 form will be required to progress the application.

### Government/Developer Funded Works

Where all external wall system remediation works for the block have been approved for Government funding under the Building Safety Fund (+18m) or Cladding Safety Scheme (11m) in England, or equivalent in Wales or the Developer has signed the Government contract to cover the cost of repairs, an EWS1 is not required.
If funding is provided by one of these routes, we don’t need any documentation, simply let us know how the works are being funded and we will complete our own checks.
We cannot proceed if an application has been made for funding but is not yet approved.

### New Build Blocks

We can issue a mortgage offer without an EWS1 for a flat/apartment in a new build block, on the understanding an acceptable EWS1 form confirming an acceptable outcome is sent to us prior to completion.
An EWS1 form may not be required if the Developer, Builder or Building Owner can provide in writing, on headed paper, confirmation that the building is being built in accordance with The Building (Amendment) Regulations 2018 (or equivalent in Wales and Scotland). Proof of appropriate planning consents may also be requested.

### Privately Funded Imminent Remediation Works

Where all external wall system works have been costed and will be funded by the Freeholder/Managing Owner (with no costs being passed to leaseholders) and are due to commence within the next 6 months, we may be able to proceed subject to the building manager/developer confirming in writing:
- The block details
- That the cost of repairs is fully funded and no costs are being passed to leaseholders
- The start date of repairs
- Expected end date of repairs
- When completed, that the works should be sufficient to ensure the block would be given an acceptable EWS1 outcome (A1, A2 or B1).

### Blocks up to 6 Storeys

For blocks up to 6 storeys high, where metal cladding is present, an EWS1 may not be required if the building owner or managing agent can confirm in writing, on headed paper, they are not constructed of ACM/MCM or HPL.
A letter will only be accepted where there is a low proportion of cladding on the building and there are no vertically stacked balconies as described below.
Where any balconies are vertically stacked above each other and either both the balustrades and decking are constructed with combustible materials (e.g., timber), or the decking is constructed with combustible materials and the balconies are directly linked by combustible materials, an EWS1 form will still be required.
An EWS1 form must be signed by an appropriately qualified individual following a full fire safety review.

### Building Safety Act Protections

Where there is no funding or no route to remediating a block, but the subject property qualifies for the protections under the Building Safety Act 2022 TSB may be able to lend.
A signed copy of the Leaseholder Deed of Certificate should be provided to be reviewed.

### EWS1 Form: Option A

TSB will accept full members (not a graduate or affiliate) of one of the following professional bodies completing Option A of the form:
- Architects Registration Board (ARB)
- Association of Consultant Approved Inspectors (ACAI)
- Chartered Association of Building Engineers (CABE)
- Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (CIAT)
- Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB)
- Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE)

RICS / CABE / IFE professionals who have completed the RICS EWS Training course may sign Option B for residential buildings below 18m which are low or medium risk. For complex or high-risk buildings (such as those incorporating a basement car park or high-risk commercial premises) an IFE member (CEng / IEng) as above would be required to complete the assessment and sign the form.

### Acceptable Outcomes

Following validation checks, TSB will accept EWS1 forms with the following outcomes:

## Employed applicants

**Source:** [Employed applicants](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/employed-applicants/)

No minimum term of employment is required.

## ​New job, promotion or pay rise

If the applicant has confirmed they will be starting a new job, receiving a pay rise or undertaking a new role with their current employer (eg accepted and offer) then the new job and higher income can be keyed on Mortgage Pro. The start date of the new job should be keyed as the date that the application has been keyed.
For pay rises or promotion/new job with their current employer, key the start date the customer joined the company.
The start date of employment must be within 3 months of the date of the full mortgage application.
In these instances, it is acceptable to provide a pay rise, promotion letter or employment contract. This must be accompanied by a covering letter on headed paper from the employer or the covering email/email chain, if the employment contract has been emailed, confirming that the applicant's contract and/or terms and conditions of employment are enclosed/attached. Where the employment contract cannot be provided, we will seek an employer’s reference.
An acceptable pay rise letter must include:*
- Applicant's name (First name and surname as a minimum)
- Employer's Name and Address
- Confirmation of salary increase with the new salary and date it starts (must be within 3 months of full mortgage application date)
- Signed and dated by the person issuing the letter, with their printed name and job title included. The letter must be issued by someone from the company's HR/payroll department or by the owner of the business/director

An acceptable promotion letter must include:*
- Applicant's name (First name and surname as a minimum)

Please see Future Changes for more information.
* A pay rise or promotion letter is a letter that is issued to the applicant(s) directly to confirm their pay rise or promotion, NOT a letter that is issued to a third party (e.g. Dear Sir / Madam or To whom it may concern) to confirm an applicant(s) pay rise or promotion. This type of letter is classed as an Employers Reference and will need to meet all Employer Reference Criteria to be acceptable.

## Income from second job

In cases where the applicant has more than one job, income can be used towards affordability if it is evidenced as sustainable.
Please see Main Income and Other Income for more information.
Please see Lending into retirement if the applicant is applying for a mortgage term which extends past their anticipated retirement age.

*Please note: For additional duty hours, flight allowance, NHS bank (to be keyed under nursing bank) or shift allowance we will average the last 3 months payslips (last 6 where paid fortnightly or last 12 where paid weekly).  Provided that each payment is within 10% of the average we will allow 100% of the income, otherwise we will allow 60%.
Example - Month 1 £95, Month 2 £100, Month 3 £105.  Total income £300, average £100pm.  As each payment is between £90 (10% below average) and £110 (10% above average) we can treat as guaranteed.  If one of the payments was below £90 or above £110 we would treat as non guaranteed even if the total income across the 3 months was the same. All the income types listed above require a main income to be keyed into Mortgage Pro for the affordability calculation, with the exception of Disability Living Allowance & Retirement Income. Where there is a strong business case to consider a standalone income listed above, this can be referred to Underwriters for consideration. Affordability must also include any known future changes to income. Please refer to Future Changes , for more information on when the known future changes should be reflected within income.

## Lending into retirement

**Source:** [Lending into retirement](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/lending-into-retirement/)

The maximum age at the end of the mortgage term is 75 years for all residential lending.
Lending into retirement policy applies to all applicants where the mortgage term will extend beyond the customer's anticipated retirement age or their 70th birthday, whichever is lower.
Where all or part of the mortgage is to be conducted on an interest only basis, lending into retirement is not acceptable. This also applies to any part of the lending on a repayment basis.
Lending Into retirement where the applicant has more than 10 years until retirement (at point of application)
- Affordability calculation will be based on the applicant’s current income only.
- Evidence will need to be provided to show the applicant is paying into a private/company pension .
- On the income into retirement screen in TSB Mortgage Pro, select ‘Pension Private – Where the customer has more than 10 years to retirement’ and key £1 in the anticipated annual amount box.
- Applicants who are already in receipt of a private pension will need to provide evidence they are paying into a separate private/company pension.
Evidence we will accept:
- Payslip with monthly pension contribution to company or private scheme.
- Private pension statement/screenshot showing pension lump sum balance (No requirement for forecast, but it is acceptable if showing on the document).
Lending Into retirement where the applicant has less than 10 years until retirement (at point of application)
- We will only use employed and self-employed income where the term of the mortgage does not exceed the applicants anticipated retirement age, or 70th birthday.
- The maximum age at the end of the mortgage term is 75 years for all residential lending.
- Future retirement income will need to be verified where the applicant is taking a mortgage term which extends beyond their anticipated retirement age or 70th birthday, whichever is the earliest.
- Affordability will be assessed on both the applicant’s current income and the future retirement income. On occasions, a further review will be required to confirm we feel it is appropriate for the applicant to borrow into retirement.

## Verifying Anticipated Retirement Income where the applicant has less than 10 years until retirement

The following evidence can be used to verify anticipated retirement income (all must be dated within the last 12 months):
- Private / Company Pension Forecast Statement (gross annual income)
- State Pension Statement (obtained from www.gov.uk )
- Annuity Statement

## Other Income

- If the applicant is in receipt of 'Other Income' this must be captured under the appropriate section of the 'Current Income' screen. If the current 'Other Income' is to continue into retirement this must be included along with any future pension income the applicant anticipates they will receive and captured in the 'Income into retirement' screen.
- The 'Income into retirement' screen must only be populated with the future income the applicant anticipates they will receive once retired, including any pension they are currently in receipt of if the applicant has less than 10 years until they retire.
- The income evidence of any pension the applicant is currently in receipt of, can be used to evidence the same pension keyed under 'Income into retirement' where the applicant has less than 10 years until retirement.

## Applicant is already Retired

- Lending into retirement policy treatment rules do not apply where an applicant is already retired.
- It is important to remember that only pension income that the client is in receipt of at the point of application can be used and captured as 'Other income' within the 'Current income' section.
- The affordability assessment will be carried out by the system on the income figure that has been entered into the 'Current income' screen.

Obvious experience over several years, even though not matching the quoted example may also be considered acceptable.
Retrospective new build warranties are not acceptable.
Leasehold new build properties must have 123 years unexpired lease at the time of mortgage commencement.
Leasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Act 2022
Ground rents on New Build Leasehold properties since 30th June 2022 are subject to meeting Government reform rules being that the ground rent must not be greater than a peppercorn amount per year (Cannot be greater than £1 annually) for it to meet our criteria to lend on the property.

- New build mortgage offers are valid for 180 days from the first offer date.
- New build mortgage offers are eligible for an extension of either 28 or 180 days if the property doesn’t complete in time.
- 180-day extension is subject to a successful re-valuation, credit search and affordability checks.
- The latest we can process the mortgage offer extension is 14 days after the mortgage offer expiry. If the extension deadline is not met, a new application must be processed and submitted as new business.
- To request an extension, please complete the New build offer extension form .
- If the case is not proceeding, please confirm using the New build offer extension form and our processing team will cancel the case. (Please be advised that once a case is cancelled, it cannot be reinstated).

## Non simultaneous sale (outstanding mortgage)

**Source:** [Non simultaneous sale (outstanding mortgage)](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/non-simultaneous-sale/)

Where the existing property is for sale but will not be sold before the new mortgage completes, the existing mortgage payment must be keyed as a credit commitment with essential running costs to be added as expenditure. These will be included in the affordability calculation.

---

## Number of applicants

**Source:** [Number of applicants](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/number-of-applicants/)

We allow a maximum of 4 applicants and will take into account the incomes of the first 2 applicants only.

---

## Occupancy

**Source:** [Occupancy](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/occupancy/)

## Additional occupants

If there will be additional occupants aged 17 and over (usually adult family members or spouse not a party to the mortgage, including children of the mortgagors) living in the property once the application has completed, you must select 'Yes' to the question 'Are there any persons aged 17 or older that are not on the mortgage living in the property?'.
Answering 'Yes' to this ensures that the system will drive you to capture their details on the 'Other occupants' screen.
Completing this also ensures the Consent to Mortgage form is included in the offer pack.
A Consent Form is not required for full time students living away from home, or a person who has turned 17 after the legal charge has been signed.
By signing the Consent to Mortgage form the additional occupants are waiving any legal rights over the property that they may have. Family may hold legal rights and therefore they are required to be recorded as additional occupants; if any lodger has acquired legal rights they too are required to be recorded as an additional occupant.
For Second Home Loans, family members living in the property must always be keyed as additional occupants and a Consent to Mortgage form is always required.
Please note: Consent to Mortgage forms do not apply to properties in Scotland. Therefore, when keying an application and it asks you to confirm if there are any persons aged 17 or older that are not on the mortgage, living in the property, key as 'NO'​.

## Remortgages

A person cannot be removed from the mortgage if they are going to continue to reside in the property.

## Tenants

It is not acceptable for a sitting tenant (under a short hold tenancy) to be occupying a residential mortgaged property on completion as there is a requirement for vacant possession.

## Lodgers

Income received from a lodger cannot be used in the affordability calculation. Up to two lodgers are acceptable providing that they are treated as a family member, i.e. sharing living accommodation.
Care must be taken if the lodger(s) has exclusive occupation of a self-contained part of the house (e.g. an annex) or the applicant does not intend to occupy the property on a permanent basis. In those types of situation, the lodger(s) may acquire legal rights.

## Applicant not resident in property

It is acceptable for a borrower not to reside at the mortgaged property and be on the mortgage subject to affordability e.g. when parents buy for a child or one spouse is temporarily living abroad for their employment.
If one applicant will occupy the property as their main residence, this can be keyed as a mainstream mortgage application and normal lending limits apply.
Applicants who do not reside at the mortgaged property on Right to Buy applications or applications involving an ex-spouse or ex-partner where they are remaining in the property or named on the mortgage application must be referred to underwriters.
Applicants who do not reside at the mortgaged property on Second Home loan applications will not be approved for a loan where they intend to let their property (under a shorthold tenancy) out temporarily immediately post completion.

## Occupancy restricted property / Covenants

**Source:** [Occupancy restricted property / Covenants](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/occupancy-restricted-property/)

## Section 106 planning agreements / restrictive covenants

Section 106 Agreements Town and Country Planning Act
Section 106 Agreements (and Unilateral Undertakings under Section 106 of the above Act) are sometimes required by the Local Authority in order for planning permission to be granted. They stipulate certain obligations that should be adhered to when the planning permission is granted (or implemented). The obligations are often intended to restrict or regulate the proposed development or use of the property and vary depending on the planning proposal. Examples of planning obligations might include:
- to limit occupation of a property to certain categories of person (e.g. locals, first time buyers, retired people)
- to bind an annexe to the main dwelling so that it cannot be sold separately and/or to restrict the occupation of an annexe to family members only.
Sometimes obligations are financial i.e. contributions to the local authority towards provision of local amenities.
It is therefore important to establish the nature of the obligations.
If the Section 106 Agreement limits occupation to specific categories of person (e.g. locals, first time buyers), consider:
- The size of the pool of possible occupants - there must be a large number of potential purchasers who meet the local authority's requirements.
- The extent to which employment is available within the local area.
- The level of income likely to be available to most potential purchasers and its adequacy to support the necessary mortgage.
- The general desirability of the area and the specific property.
We will consider lending against the security of the property which is subject to such an agreement. The Valuer will assess the impact of any such agreement on our security, and by exception will request the application is referred to Underwriters if they feel further guidance is required. No commitment of any kind may be given to any customer prior to such consideration.
Keying a section 106/Restricted Re-sale Price ( re-sale price covenant ) case
- Make enquiries before keying to find out as much information as possible regarding the restriction (e.g % discount, how long the restriction applies for, eligibility criteria).
- The case should be keyed as a standard application (Any applications subject to any other schemes in conjunction will be declined).
- The property value keyed represents the amount they are purchasing the property for or for a remortgage the percentage of the market value they own (It is not the higher full market value figure).
- 
- Contact your Regional Case Management team ( Contact us | TSB Intermediaries ) to advise them of the details of the restriction. The team will then add a special condition detailing the restrictions to the application.
- Our guidance notes for valuers advise that for a resale price covenant they should report the value at the appropriate percentage discount.
Discounted Market Sales
Discount Market Sales are acceptable providing they meet the conditions of the Affordable Housing Scheme and the discount is subsequently passed on from purchaser to purchaser.  Where the discount is only offered to the original purchaser this would be classed as a Concessionary Purchase and would be outside of policy.
Occupancy Restrictions/Restrictive Covenants
- Valuers must report any of the facts in relation to the restriction(s) and the impact of these restrictions must be reflected in the valuation. Sometimes, the valuer may be aware that a restriction exists but has not been provided the full details to enable them to consider how it may adversely impact marketability, so it’s important we find out as much information about the restriction for the valuer to review.
- The below highlights acceptable restrictive covenants (this is not an exhaustive list) One of the recognised councils in England, Scottish Local Authorities or Welsh Unitary Authorities - if unsure, refer to Property Risk. Right of First Refusal (RFR) for social landlords to buy back homes purchased under Right to Buy (Section 156 Agreement) Keyworker/Essential worker schemes National Parks
- One of the recognised councils in England, Scottish Local Authorities or Welsh Unitary Authorities - if unsure, refer to Property Risk.
- Right of First Refusal (RFR) for social landlords to buy back homes purchased under Right to Buy (Section 156 Agreement)

- Right of First Refusal (RFR) for social landlords to buy back homes purchased under Right to Buy (Section 156 Agreement)
- Keyworker/Essential worker schemes
- National Parks
Restricted Re-Sale Price (Re-Sale Price Covenant) - The valuation must be reported at the applicable percentage of Market Value. For example, if the property cannot be sold for more than 70% of market value then the valuation provided should reflect this percentage and 70% of the market value used as the present condition value. When this restriction applies, a special condition should be added.
Restricted Re-Sale (Re-Sale Covenant) - In these cases the property is subject to a covenant or other restriction which limits the sale to persons in a particular class or classes, e.g. a person must have resided in the area for a particular length of time and/or be employed in a specific industry. The valuation must be reported at 100% of market value considering the restrictions.
The following restrictive covenants are unacceptable in all cases:
- Property restricted to age of occupier (Over 55s)
- Time usage of dwelling (E.g. - Can only be used 11 months out of the year)
- Property restricted to agriculture use including Fishery, Equestrian, forestry
- Purchaser(s) must be living and/or working in a small geographical area (e.g. specific parish) which is not in the list of acceptable areas
- Property ownership restricted to a specified age group
- Limit on mortgage payment as a proportion of income (if the valuer is aware)
- Fixed capital values E.g. The property cannot be sold for more than the original purchase price
- Any BTL property with occupancy restrictions
- Help to buy applications subject to section 106/75 agreements
- Properties subject to overage agreements

## Resale Price Covenant Schemes

Resale/Resale Price Covenant Schemes can be supported by TSB subject to specific terms being met. Therefore, if a case relates to a Resale Price Covenant Scheme, please request a copy of the latest TSB Affordable Housing Scheme Guidance Notes and confirm with the conveyancer that the scheme meets these specific terms prior to a mortgage offer being generated.

## Early Repayment Charges (ERCs)


### Simultaneous porting

- If the porting is simultaneous, i.e. the new loan starts on the same day the existing one is redeemed, our processing team will add a note to the case to ensure that ERCs are waived – please ensure you let us know that the transactions are planned to be simultaneous.
- Where a customer is porting a reduced amount because this is the amount they require for the new purchase or is the maximum they can borrow, the full ERC will be waived.
- If the customer is porting <90% of the mortgage balance or sub account and wants to take other borrowing on a new rate which would cover the amount they are not porting, a partial ERC would be charged.  If porting > 90% the whole ERC will be waived.

### Non-simultaneous porting

If the redemption and completion of the existing and new mortgage are not simultaneous the following applies:
- The applicant(s) will be required to pay any ERCs at the point of redemption. Once the new mortgage completes, eligible applicant(s) can request a refund of the ERC.
- Where a customer is porting a reduced amount because this is the amount they require for the new purchase or is the maximum they can borrow, the full ERC will be waived.
- If the customer is porting <90% of the mortgage balance or sub account and wants to take other borrowing on a new rate which would cover the amount they are not porting, a partial ERC would be charged.
- A new mortgage application to port the original rate must have been fully submitted within a maximum of three months from the date of the redemption of the existing mortgage to port the original rate and qualify for refund of the ERCs (for account numbers starting with 20 or 40)

## Property

**Source:** [Property](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/property/)

The minimum valuation for all residential lending is £50,000. (For shared ownership, value of share must be at least £50,000).
All flats must have a minimum internal habitable floor area of 30sqm (excluding balconies or terraces).
Flats with balcony/open deck access arrangements within the block are acceptable subject to specific criteria – see Flats with balcony/open deck access for more information.

## Condition

The property must meet minimum criteria. It must be habitable, readily saleable, structurally sound and be able to have buildings insurance arranged upon it. We do not offer retentions. We will not provide a valid offer until any works considered essential by the Valuer are completed and confirmed as satisfactory.

## Estate Management/Maintenance Charges and Service Charges for Freehold Properties

Freehold properties that are subject to an estate management/maintenance/service charge or any additional monthly charge should meet the below criteria.
Subject to valuation and insurance being available on standard terms is as follows:
- Charges on properties built pre-2005 are acceptable.
- Charges on properties built since January 2005 are capped to a maximum of the higher of 0.2% of the Market Value or £500.
- Charges must be keyed under "Ground Rent" to be included in the affordability assessment.

## Service Charges for Leasehold Properties

Service charges are acceptable subject to surveyor's comments on marketability and saleability.

## Leasehold property

Leasehold properties must have a minimum unexpired term of 70 years at mortgage commencement, and 30 years remaining at mortgage redemption.
New build leasehold properties must have a minimum unexpired lease term of 123 years at mortgage commencement.
When a lease is below 85 years, this could impact the marketability of the property and will therefore be subject to the local valuer’s assessment

## Ground Rent

Our Ground Rent criteria, subject to valuation and insurance being available on standard terms, is as follows:
Ground rents on properties built pre-2005 are acceptable subject to being reasonable throughout the lease term:
- Increases linked to RPI or similar index are acceptable.
- Ground rents which double periodically every 20 years or more are acceptable.
- Ground rents which double periodically less than every 19 years are unacceptable.
Ground rents on properties built since January 2005 are subject to the above criteria, plus a maximum cap:
- 0.1% of Market Value per annum for new build houses
- The higher of 0.1% of market value or £250 per annum for new build flats/maisonettes and all second hand/resale properties.
Common hold property is not accepted.
Leasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Act 2022
Ground rents on New Build Leasehold properties since 30th June 2022 are subject to meeting Government reform rules being that the ground rent must not be greater than a peppercorn amount per year (Cannot be greater than £1 annually) for it to meet our criteria to lend on the property.
TSB will not lend on New Build properties where the lease was created after the 30 th June 2022 and the ground rent is higher than a peppercorn.

## Other Freehold Arrangements

We can proceed if the freehold of the whole building is mortgaged to us by the applicant and:
- They are the landlord of the other flats (which must be held on a long lease) and
- The maximum number of flats within the whole building is four, including the flat we are being asked to lend against.
For flats within a building of not more than 4 flats where the customer owns a leasehold flat and is also the Sole freeholder of the whole building, our mortgage must be registered on both the freehold and leasehold titles.
If the flat has an element of leasehold you should check to make sure that they are purchasing the leasehold interest and a share of the freehold.
Freehold flats that do not meet the above criteria are unacceptable.

## High rise flats

There is no maximum limit on number of floors, permitting there is a lift to the floor of the property.
Where there is no lift in the block, and the subject property is located higher than the 4 th floor (ground plus three floors) this would be unacceptable.

## Ex Local Authority properties

The maximum number of floors acceptable to TSB in an ex-local authority block is 6 storeys (ground plus 5). Blocks higher than this are unacceptable. This also applies to maisonettes and Scottish Tenements.
The property must be readily saleable and not a lone owner occupied flat within a Local Authority tenanted block. The property must be of standard construction.

## Properties above, adjacent or near to commercial premises

These can be considered subject to valuer’s comments.

- the proximity of the commercial use must not affect the quiet enjoyment of the property
- consideration should be given to the location of the property

This is not an exhaustive list.
Properties located above convenience stores / small supermarkets are acceptable.
Any residential security must have a suitable access, which must not be through a business premises.

## Specialist reports

If a specialist report is required as part of the valuation process, the following are examples of acceptable qualifications and professional memberships:

## Studio flats

Studio flats are acceptable across the UK, subject to valuer's comments and a minimum habitable internal floor area of 30sqm (excluding balconies or terraces).
Where all or part of the mortgage is to be conducted on an interest only basis, and the repayment vehicle is ‘sale of the security property’ Studio Flats are not acceptable.

## Flats with balcony/open deck access

There is no maximum limit on number of floors, permitting there is a lift to the floor of the property.
Where there is no lift in the block, and the subject property is located higher than the 4 th floor (ground plus three floors) this would be unacceptable.
Flats in blocks with balcony / deck access are acceptable subject to:
- Must have secured access at ground floor level (i.e. gates / electronic entry / security guard)

## Remortgages

**Source:** [Remortgages](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/remortgages/)

- The property must have been registered in the applicant's name (or at least one of the applicants' names) for a minimum of 6 months unless the property has been inherited and the applicant is a beneficiary.
- Applications where the applicant is not a beneficiary of the inherited property, and the beneficiary has owned the property for less than 6 months, are not acceptable.
- The maximum LTV we will consider lending on remortgages with no additional borrowing is 90%.
A person cannot be removed from the mortgage if they are going to continue to reside in the property.
Debt to income policy will apply, please see affordability for more details.

## Capital raising

When an applicant is looking to raise additional capital, the loan will be restricted to a maximum of 85% (subject to credit score).
We do not lend for the following purposes (at any LTV):
- Timeshares
- Business capital raising (including Limited Company Buy To Lets)
- Speculative purposes (includes stocks and shares, currency speculation and cryptocurrency).
Where the property is mortgage free (unencumbered), these applications are also treated as remortgages.
In some cases, TSB may ask for additional evidence of what the additional borrowing will be used for (quotes/written estimates for home improvements for example).
If your client is capital raising to purchase another property, all future costs must be included on the application and if they’re using the money raised to purchase a BTL property, we require evidence of estimated rental income too.

## Debt consolidation

Any additional borrowing being raised for unsecured debt consolidation must not be more than 20% of the property value (this rule does not apply to secured debts being consolidated).
The loan will be restricted to a maximum of 85% (subject to credit score).
Where an applicant wants to consolidate their secured and unsecured debts, the following policy will apply:
- The debt consolidation must be on a repayment basis only.
- Any debt consolidation should be set up on a single sub account and must be separate to other borrowing.
- Debt consolidation can be taken into retirement subject to our lending into retirement criteria.
If the customer is repaying a friend or family member for borrowing in the past, debt consolidation only applies if there is a formal legal agreement in place to repay the debt.
TSB will not lend to customers who fall into one of the following categories;
- Are in financial difficulty (i.e. cannot afford their current borrowing).
- Have less than 12 months repayments left to pay on their current debts or intends to pay the debt in the next 12 months, at the time of the mortgage application. This is not applicable for Credit Cards, Overdrafts or other revolving debts.
- Consolidation of student loans, child maintenance payments, Forces Help to Buy/Long Service Advance of Pay (property deposits) or pay day loans.

## Shared ownership mortgages

**Source:** [Shared ownership mortgages](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/shared-ownership-mortgages/)

## Only available in England and Wales

The maximum LTV we will consider lending on shared ownership properties is 95% (85% for New Build flats and maisonettes) of the value of the share of the property the applicant(s) is buying / will own (not the full market value of the whole property).
The minimum valuation for all residential lending is £50,000. (For shared ownership, value of share must be at least £50,000).
The following rules apply to shared ownership properties:
- The monthly rental payment must be keyed to the "Shared Ownership Rent" field in Mortgage Pro. If the rent varies or increases over time, the higher amount must be keyed.
- An applicant(s) minimum share must be for at least 25% and the maximum share on initial purchase cannot exceed 85%.
- The applicant(s) initial purchase is based on a long lease (minimum of 70 years or 123 years on all new build properties) and may be for as low as a 25% share. The applicant(s) can purchase further shares in the property, reducing the rent they pay and increasing their ownership of the property. Increasing the shareholding is known as ‘staircasing’.
- When a lease is below 85 years, this could impact the marketability of the property and will therefore be subject to the local valuer’s assessment.
- The mortgage must be conducted on a full repayment basis.
- The facility to transfer the mortgage to full or part interest-only is not available whilst the mortgage is conducted on a shared ownership basis.

### Shared ownership remortgage

When keying Shared Ownership remortgages, the value of the applicant's share should be entered in the "Estimated Value of the share" and the full market value in the "Full Market Value" box. This will ensure the correct product is provided for selection.
Shared Ownership remortgages should be processed using the Shared Ownership/Shared Equity product range, and follow the same policy as for standard remortgages e.g. Maximum LTV of 85% (of applicant's share) if additional borrowing is required.
Additional lending for the purpose of home improvements is permitted at the time of application. The applicant will need to provide confirmation from the Housing Association/Local Authority of their agreement to the additional borrowing and that it will be covered by the Mortgagee Protection Clause/Section 442 Guarantee or NICOHA side agreement.
Where applicants intend to purchase the final tranche of Shared Ownership, choose from the ‘Own Conveyancer’ product range with cashback from the remortgage section. You’ll need to make us aware of the transaction by contacting our Mortgage Application Team on option 2, a special condition will be added to the Mortgage Offer to avoid delays at completion.

## Sub-sales and back-to-back transactions

**Source:** [Sub-sales and back-to-back transactions](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/sub-sales-back-to-back-transactions/)

- Sub-sales and back-to-back transactions are not acceptable.
- A sub-sale occurs when a property is bought and then sold on within six months. Date of registration at the Land Registry is how we determine the length of ownership.
- This means that the current vendor must have owned the property for at least six months before we can accept an application to purchase that property, unless the property has been inherited .
- A back-to-back transaction is a type of sub-sale where the intervening seller buys from the original seller and sells on to the borrower on the same day or within a few days. We also regard as sub-sales, cases where the seller acquires the freehold (or superior leasehold) title to the property, which they then immediately sell on to the borrower by the grant to them of a lease (or sub-lease).
- The following cases are exceptions where it is acceptable for the property to be sold on within six months of acquisition by the seller.
- Where sales are by: A personal representative of the registered proprietor; or An institutional mortgagee exercising its power of sale; or A receiver, trustee-in-bankruptcy or liquidator; or A registered housing provider (Housing Association) exercising a power of sale; or A developer or builder selling a property acquired under a part-exchange scheme. Applications which involve assignable contracts or irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of intervening sellers are not acceptable. Any other structure to the transaction which has a similar effect should be reported to us.
- A personal representative of the registered proprietor; or
- An institutional mortgagee exercising its power of sale; or
- A receiver, trustee-in-bankruptcy or liquidator; or
- A registered housing provider (Housing Association) exercising a power of sale; or
- A developer or builder selling a property acquired under a part-exchange scheme.
- Applications which involve assignable contracts or irrevocable powers of attorney in favour of intervening sellers are not acceptable. Any other structure to the transaction which has a similar effect should be reported to us.

- The property is owned by your employer and you pay rent directly to the employer
- The property is owned by a third party and you pay directly to your employer who passes the payment to the owner of the property
- The property is owned by a third party and you pay the rent directly to the third party; the employer's role is only to facilitate the arrangements.
Applicants that want to buy a house, but their intention is to live in that property in the future while they continue to live in tied accommodation, are acceptable to apply using the policy criteria below. We need to establish how the property will be used, and if the intention is to let the property while the applicant remains in tied accommodation, or if the applicant is to occupy the property themselves (if the applicant will be living in the property upon completion then the criteria below does not apply).

- Maximum LTV is 75% (or 65% for a new build property)
- Maximum LTV is 95% (or 80% for a new build property) where the applicants are living in military accommodation or are diplomatic staff)
- Agreement must be in place for any tenants: Assured Shorthold tenancy (AST – English cases only), Occupation Contract (Welsh cases only), Private Residential Tenancy (PRT - Scottish cases only)
- Assured Shorthold tenancy (AST – English cases only),

- Private Residential Tenancy (PRT - Scottish cases only)
- Product can be selected from our standard residential product range
- Affordability of the loan will not be based on Buy-to-Let self-funding calculations.
- Customers must apply for Consent to Lease (Consent to Lease phone number is 0345 835 3381 ) post completion but before any letting starts. CTL will be granted for the time a customer is expecting to remain in tied accommodation.
- Assured Shorthold tenancy (AST – English cases only),

## Affordability

**Source:** [Affordability](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/buy-to-let/affordability/)

In order to meet the self financing calculation for Buy to Let mortgages, the rental income is required to cover 125% of the mortgage interest for basic rate taxpayers (both applicants must be basic rate taxpayers), or 145% of the mortgage interest for higher or additional rate taxpayers. Where applicants are self-employed, day rate contractors or on £0 income, the interest coverage ratio will be 145% irrespective of whether they are basic, higher, or additional rate taxpayers, including joint applications. The table below shows the stressed interest rates we apply for different application types:
Re-mortgages with no additional borrowing (excluding residential to BTL / Let to Buy): Higher of 4.75% or product rate +1%
All other application types (including residential to BTL / Let to Buy): Higher of 5.50% or product rate +2%
Where applicants are basic rate taxpayers, and the lending is not affordable on an interest coverage ratio of 145% at a stressed interest rate of 5.50%, all taxable income must be keyed, we will look to evidence all income in line with how we evidence income on mainstream applications - Income, Verification - Main Income | TSB Intermediaries Income, Verification - Other Income | TSB Intermediaries . Where any applicant is self-employed or a day rate contractor we will not look to evidence any income keyed.
When considering total income to establish the applicants tax banding we will include rental income for mortgaged Buy To Let properties (including property subject to mortgage application), and will make a deduction of 17.3% from the rental income keyed to the application to cover costs (e.g. £10,000 gross rental equates to £8270 after costs which will count towards total taxable income to establish tax banding). Whilst acknowledging costs will vary from property to property, we will apply the same deduction across the board in all instances.
Rental income from unencumbered properties is treated as self employed income, and therefore we will not look to evidence this and will apply an interest coverage ratio of 145% in this scenario. Rental income for the property subject to the mortgage application will be validated by the valuers estimate, and background mortgaged properties can be evidenced by any of the following:
- 3 months bank statements (showing rental income).
- Tenancy agreement (current agreement required, not to be out of date/expired).
- Letter/invoice/statement from letting agent managing the property.
- Letter from accountant or solicitor.
- Letter from letting agent confirming expected rental payment (where not currently let).
For like for like remortgages the balance keyed must align to the current mortgage balance as per credit bureau.  If the requested loan is higher than that traced at the credit bureau we will either need additional documentation to confirm the current balance or the requested loan will need to be reduced to match the current balance as per credit bureau.
Should the rental income be insufficient to meet the self funding calculation then the loan amount must be reduced to fit. Personal income may not be utilised to meet any shortfall in rental income.
For Buy-to-Let applications the valuer will provide an expected market rental value figure.
The self-financing calculation must also cover the product fee if this is to be added to the loan.

## EWS1 Process – Cladding & External Wall System

**Source:** [EWS1 Process – Cladding & External Wall System](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/buy-to-let/ews1-btl/)

Where a Valuer has specific concerns with the materials used for the external wall system, they will recommend us to seek confirmation of the fire safety status of the block, in line with the latest RICS guidance.
Below details our cladding policy, in some scenarios an EWS1 form may not be required. In the event none of the scenarios apply, an EWS1 form will be required to progress the application.

### Government/Developer Funded Works

Where all external wall system remediation works for the block have been approved for Government funding under the Building Safety Fund (+18m) or Cladding Safety Scheme (11m) in England, or equivalent in Wales or the Developer has signed the Government contract to cover the cost of repairs, an EWS1 is not required.
If funding is provided by one of these routes, we don’t need any documentation, simply let us know how the works are being funded and we will complete our own checks.
We cannot proceed if an application has been made for funding but is not yet approved.

### New Build Blocks

We can issue a mortgage offer without an EWS1 for a flat/apartment in a new build block, on the understanding an acceptable EWS1 form confirming an acceptable outcome is sent to us prior to completion.
An EWS1 form may not be required if the Developer, Builder or Building Owner can provide in writing, on headed paper, confirmation that the building is being built in accordance with The Building (Amendment) Regulations 2018 (or equivalent in Wales and Scotland). Proof of appropriate planning consents may also be requested.

### Privately Funded Imminent Remediation Works

Where all external wall system works have been costed and will be funded by the Freeholder/Managing Owner (with no costs being passed to leaseholders) and are due to commence within the next 6 months, we may be able to proceed subject to the building manager/developer confirming in writing:
- The block details
- That the cost of repairs is fully funded and no costs are being passed to leaseholders
- The start date of repairs
- Expected end date of repairs
- When completed, that the works should be sufficient to ensure the block would be given an acceptable EWS1 outcome (A1, A2 or B1).

### Blocks up to 6 Storeys

For blocks up to 6 storeys high, where metal cladding is present, an EWS1 may not be required if the building owner or managing agent can confirm in writing, on headed paper, they are not constructed of ACM/MCM or HPL.
A letter will only be accepted where there is a low proportion of cladding on the building and there are no vertically stacked balconies as described below.
Where any balconies are vertically stacked above each other and either both the balustrades and decking are constructed with combustible materials (e.g., timber), or the decking is constructed with combustible materials and the balconies are directly linked by combustible materials, an EWS1 form will still be required.
An EWS1 form must be signed by an appropriately qualified individual following a full fire safety review.

### Building Safety Act Protections

Where there is no funding or no route to remediating a block, but the subject property qualifies for the protections under the Building Safety Act 2022 TSB may be able to lend.
A signed copy of the Leaseholder Deed of Certificate should be provided to be reviewed.

### EWS1 Form: Option A

TSB will accept full members (not a graduate or affiliate) of one of the following professional bodies completing Option A of the form:
- Architects Registration Board (ARB)
- Association of Consultant Approved Inspectors (ACAI)
- Chartered Association of Building Engineers (CABE)

- Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB)
- Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE)

- Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE)
- Local Authority Building Control (LABC)
- Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA)

- Society of Façade Engineers (SFE)

### Option B

TSB will accept the form with Option B completed by an individual that is a Chartered or Incorporated Engineer (CEng or IEng) with full membership with the IFE (MIFireE or FIFireE).
RICS / CABE / IFE professionals who have completed the RICS EWS Training course may sign Option B for residential buildings below 18m which are low or medium risk. For complex or high-risk buildings (such as those incorporating a basement car park or high-risk commercial premises) an IFE member (CEng / IEng) as above would be required to complete the assessment and sign the form.

### Acceptable Outcomes

Following validation checks, TSB will accept EWS1 forms with the following outcomes:
- A1
- A2
- B1

## Portability

**Source:** [Portability](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/buy-to-let/portability/)

An existing portable Buy-to-Let product may be ported onto a new Buy-to-Let property.
Buy-to-Let products cannot be ported onto a residential property and residential products cannot be ported onto Buy-to-Let properties.

---

## Property

**Source:** [Property](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/buy-to-let/property/)

The minimum valuation for all lending is £50,000.
All flats must have a minimum habitable internal area of 30 sqm (excluding balconies or terraces).
Flats with balcony/ open deck access arrangements within the block are acceptable subject to specific criteria – see Flats with balcony/open deck access for more information.

## Condition

Not available for properties which require renovation prior to letting. This does not include minor redecoration, but the property needs to be in sufficiently good condition that the valuer believes it is immediately habitable and can provide an immediate rental figure per month. For example, where a property requires complete replacement of the bathroom and/or kitchen, this would render it ineligible for a BTL application.

## Energy rating

All privately rented properties in England & Wales must meet the minimum energy efficiency regulations by law. We will not accept properties with Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) of F & G unless a valid exemption has been registered. If improvements need to be made to improve the EPC rating of the property, we will not provide a mortgage offer until the improvements have been completed and an updated EPC is available confirming the higher rating.
https://prsregister.beis.gov.uk/NdsBeisUi/register-search-exemptions
The EPC register can be found here - https://www.epcregister.com

## Estate Management/Maintenance Charges and Service Charges for Freehold Properties

Freehold properties that are subject to an estate management/maintenance/service charge or any additional monthly charge should meet the below criteria.
Subject to valuation and insurance being available on standard terms is as follows:
- Charges on properties built pre-2005 are acceptable.
- Charges on properties built since January 2005 are capped to a maximum of the higher of 0.2% of the Market Value or £500.
- Charges must be keyed under "Ground Rent" to be included in the affordability assessment.

## Service Charges for Leasehold Properties

Service charges are acceptable subject to surveyor's comments on marketability and saleability.

## Leasehold property

Leasehold properties must have a minimum unexpired term of 70 years at mortgage commencement, and 30 years remaining at mortgage redemption.
New build leasehold properties must have a minimum unexpired lease term of 123 years at mortgage commencement.
When a lease is below 85 years, this could impact the marketability of the property and will therefore be subject to the local valuer’s assessment

## Flats with balcony/open deck access

There is no maximum limit on number of floors, permitting there is a lift to the floor of the property.
Where there is no lift in the block, and the subject property is located higher than the 4th floor (ground plus three floors) this would be unacceptable.
Flats in blocks with balcony / deck access are acceptable subject to:
- Must have secured access at ground floor level (i.e. gates / electronic entry / security guard)
- Valuer must confirm the property is marketable and mortgageable.
- All other property policies apply, e.g. cladding, maximum number of floors with/without a lift.

## Ground Rent

Our Ground Rent criteria, subject to valuation and insurance being available on standard terms, is as follows:
Ground rents on properties built pre-2005 are acceptable subject to being reasonable throughout the lease term:
- Increases linked to RPI or similar index are acceptable.
- Ground rents which double periodically every 20 years or more are acceptable.
- Ground rents which double periodically less than every 19 years are unacceptable.
Ground rents on properties built since January 2005 are subject to the above criteria, plus a maximum cap:
- 0.1% of Market Value per annum for new build houses
- The higher of 0.1% of market value or £250 per annum for new build flats/maisonettes and all second hand/resale properties.
Commonhold property is not accepted.
Leasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Act 2022
Ground rents on New Build Leasehold properties since 30th June 2022 are subject to meeting Government reform rules being that the ground rent must not be greater than a peppercorn amount per year (Cannot be greater than £1 annually) for it to meet our criteria to lend on the property.
TSB will not lend on New Build properties where the lease was created after the 30 th June 2022 and the ground rent is higher than a peppercorn.

## Other Freehold Arrangements

We can proceed if the freehold of the whole building is mortgaged to us by the applicant and:
- They are the landlord of the other flats (which must be held on a long lease) and
- The maximum number of flats within the whole building is four, including the flat we are being asked to lend against.
For flats within a building of not more than 4 flats where the customer owns a leasehold flat and is also the Sole freeholder of the whole building, our mortgage must be registered on both the freehold and leasehold titles.
If the flat has an element of leasehold you should check to make sure that they are purchasing the leasehold interest and a share of the freehold.
Freehold flats that do not meet the above criteria are unacceptable.

## High rise flats

There is no maximum number of floors permitting there is a lift to the floor of the subject property.
For blocks without a lift, the subject property cannot be located higher than the 3rd floor (ground plus three).

## Ex local authority properties

The maximum number of floors acceptable to TSB in an ex-local authority block is 6 storeys (ground plus 5). Blocks higher than this are unacceptable. This also applies to maisonettes and Scottish Tenements.
Ex-local authority flats are not considered unless the majority of the building is owner-occupied.
The property must be of standard construction.

## Properties above, adjacent or near to commercial premises

These can be considered subject to valuers’ comments.
Properties which are above, adjacent or near to commercial premises may be acceptable subject to the following:
- flats over commercial premises must be in separate ownership to the commercial premises
- the proximity of the commercial use must not affect the quiet enjoyment of the property
- consideration should be given to the location of the property
The property must be located in a desirable area with good demand, readily saleable and readily marketable, for example properties which are adjacent to, or in very close proximity to a public house, night club, petrol station, laundrette, pet shop or hot food takeaway where the method of cooking is likely to cause smell or fumes would not be deemed as suitable security.  This is not an exhaustive list Properties located above convenience stores/small supermarkets are acceptable.
Properties located above convenience stores/small supermarkets are acceptable.
Any residential security must have a suitable access, which must not be through a business premises. Where the intended security is a flat situated adjoining or over the premises, the business property cannot be owned by the same person as this would have legal implications in the event of repossession.

## Studio flats

Studio flats are acceptable across the UK, subject to valuer's comments and a minimum habitable internal floor area of 30sqm (excluding balconies or terraces).

## Unacceptable properties

- Any property over which buildings insurance cannot be arranged on standard terms

Where the applicant is looking to raise additional capital, we are unable to lend for the following purposes:
- Timeshares.
- Business capital raising (including Limited Company Buy To Lets)
- Speculative purposes (includes stocks and shares, currency speculation and cryptocurrency)
Where the property is mortgage free (unencumbered), these applications are also treated as remortgages.

​Where additional borrowing is being used to repay unsecured debts, the amount being raised for debt consolidation must not be greater than 20% of the property value.
Where an applicant wants to consolidate their secured and unsecured debts, the following policy will apply:
- The debt consolidation must be on a repayment basis only.
- Any debt consolidation should be set up on a single sub account and must be separate to other borrowing.
- Debt consolidation can be taken into retirement provided retirement income is fully evidenced.
If the customer is repaying a friend or family member for borrowing in the past, debt consolidation only applies if there is a formal legal agreement in place to repay the debt.
TSB will not lend to customers who fall into one of the following categories;
- Are in financial difficulty (i.e. cannot afford their current borrowing).
- Have less than 12 months repayments left to pay on their current debts or intends to pay the debt in the next 12 months, at the time of the mortgage application. This is not applicable for Credit Cards, Overdrafts or other revolving debts.
