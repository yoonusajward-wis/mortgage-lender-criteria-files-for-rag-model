## CONTRACTORS

Source: [https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/contractors/](https://intermediary.tsb.co.uk/criteria/residential-criteria/contractors/)

---

## SUBCONTRACTORS, FIXED/SHORT TERM CONTRACTS, AGENCY WORKERS AND UMBRELLA COMPANIES

The applicant must have 12 months contract history (exception: Junior Doctors require 6 months contract history), evidencing no gaps exceeding 6 weeks, with at least 3 months remaining on the current contract. If less than 3 months remain, a future contract showing a minimum of 3 months future employment will be required.

Where contract history is less than 12 months and the applicant is in a Professional occupation, a referral can be made to Underwriters for consideration.

Where the applicant has provided 12 months contract history but is now on a rolling contract or the current contract does not evidence an end date more than 3 months in the future, the current employer or agency must provide written confirmation that the contract remains valid. The letter must be provided directly from the employer or agency and must contain:

* Name of the customer (first name and surname as a minimum)
* Name of employer or agency
* Day rate amount
* Confirmation the contract remains valid

Income verification required:

* Latest P60

* 12 months contract history evidencing consistent and sustainable income

---

## DAY RATE CONTRACTORS

Customers must have a minimum income of £50,000 from their average day rate. No other income counts toward this minimum. Bonus, overtime, commission and location/car allowance will not be considered for affordability.

Customers must have 12 months contract history, evidencing no gaps exceeding 6 weeks, with at least 3 months remaining. If less than 3 months remain, a future contract showing a minimum of 3 months future employment will be required. If on a rolling contract, the employer or agency must confirm the contract remains valid.

Day rate income calculation:

Multiply the average day rate for the last 12 months by 5 days and then by 46 weeks. Future contracts may be included if applicable.

If two contracts in last 12 months at £400 and £300 per day, average day rate is £350. Annual income would be £350 × 5 × 46 = £80,500.

A basic salary must also be captured. This should match day rate × 5 × 46 unless working other than 5 days per week. The lower of the captured basic salary or calculated day rate income will be used for affordability.

If contract specifies number of days worked, use that figure. Example: 4 days per week at £350: £350 × 4 × 46 = £64,400.

Shift pattern calculation:

Divide days worked by total days in cycle (worked + rest days), multiply by 7, multiply by day rate, multiply by 46. Example 12 on / 12 off: 12 / (12+12) = 0.5; 0.5 × 7 × £350 × 46 = £56,350.

Additional living and travel costs must be keyed as “other” in household expenditure.

Maximum LTV where day rate contractor income used: 95%.
For Buy To Let: 80% maximum LTV.

Where contractor employed via LTD company and ownership share less than 100% and/or contract in LTD name, self-employed criteria applies.
