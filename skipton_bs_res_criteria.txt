## A-Z Lending Criteria

## People

### Age Limits

**Applicant Age Limits**

We usually require all applicants to be a minimum of 18 years of age, however for our [Track Record Mortgage](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria/track-record-mortgage/) we require all applicants to be 21.
For residential lending we can consider a maximum age of 75 (before the applicants 76th birthday) at the end of the mortgage term. However, where the mortgage term goes beyond the applicant’s 71st birthday or their elected retirement age, (whichever is reached first), then evidence of retirement income will be required to allow the impact of retirement on affordability to be assessed. For further information please refer to [Lending Into Retirement](#lending-into-retirement).
If the applicant is retired and only using pension income then a maximum age of 80 (before their 81st birthday) can be considered. However, this only applies to applications that are on a Capital & Interest repayment basis.
If an applicant’s income is not being included in the affordability assessment then the maximum age limits detailed above will not apply to that applicant. However, all debts for that same applicant will still need to be included in the affordability assessment.

### CIS Workers

For Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) workers we will require the following:

* 1 year's summary of payments from either employer(s) or accountant and 1 month's bank statement showing the income.

Or

* Latest years SA302 with 1 month's bank statement evidencing the payments.

To calculate income we will use a 12 month gross average (minus materials), or the net figure from the SA302.

**Please note 12 months' worth of weekly remittance slips will not be accepted as evidence of income.**

### Contractors (Self Employed)

Please see below our requirements if your client operates within their chosen profession as a self-employed Contractor.

#### Contractor on a Day Rate Contract

If your client is a Contractor on a day rate contract we will require the following:

* Minimum of 2 years' experience in the same field of work (as evidenced by the applicants CV or 2 years contracts).
* Minimum of 12 months contract history.
* Copy of current contract (where less than 3 months remain on the current contract a copy of the next contract/confirmation letter must be provided).
* Copy of 1 months personal or 1-months business bank statement showing contractor income and general expenditure.

To calculate income, we will use their daily contract rate x5 x 46 (weeks) irrespective of whether they are operating as a Sole Trader or through a Limited Company.

Operating through a Limited Company is only acceptable where the applicant is the sole shareholder, or the shareholding is split with a spouse/partner who is party to the mortgage application. If any other 3rd party is named on the Limited Company then this will result in the application being processed on a standard self-employed basis and the daily rate calculation will not be available. If the partner/spouse draws an income from the business this cannot be used for affordability along with day rate as this would be double counting.

The daily rate must be entered as earned income on [eMortgages](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/emortgages/) (in the 'Contractor Income' field).

Where there are gaps of more than 4 weeks in the employment history in the last 12 months the income calculation will be pro-rated (e.g. for an 8 week gap the calculation used will be daily contract rate x 5 x 38 weeks).

#### Locum Medical Professionals, Supply Teachers and Zero Hours Contracts

For Locum medical professionals (including Bank Nurses), Supply Teachers and Zero Hours Contracts we will require the following:

* Minimum 12 months experience in the same field
* Copy of current contract (where available)
* Latest months bank statement
* Latest months' payslip/invoice
* Latest P60.

To calculate income we will use the lower of the year to date figure shown on the latest payslip or P60.

#### Fixed term Contracts

If your client is working on a Fixed Term contract we will require the following:

* Minimum 12 months experience in the same field (as evidenced by the Applicant's CV)
* Copy of current contract (where there is less than 3 months remaining on the current contract a copy of next contract/confirmation letter must also be provided)
* Latest months bank statement
* Latest months' payslip/invoice.

Income will be calculated on the contract income and backed up by the latest payslip.

For information on our requirements for **Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) workers**, please refer to **CIS Workers.**

### Credit Search / History

Dependants are defined as any person (excluding partners) who is financially dependent on the mortgage applicant(s)
Dependants consist of:
Dependant Adult - aged 18 years and over and financially dependent on the applicant(s)Dependant Child - aged less than 18 years and financially dependent on the applicant(s)
In addition for the purposes of clarity:
Partners are excluded as such information is captured elsewhere as part of the affordability assessmentWhere an applicant has advised maintenance is being paid for dependants not residing in the property, these persons should be excluded, to avoid duplication in the assessment
The following are not financial dependants - any occupants of a property who are:
Self funding (e.g. retired parents with adequate pension income)In full time employment with an adequate level of income
If there is any element of financial dependency then the individual should be regarded as a dependant (e.g. if at university and either fully or partially reliant on parent(s). This includes fostered children).

Income included in Affordability Assessment
We accept 100% of:
Permanent basic income.Contractual Income (any other contractual guaranteed income e.g. Car/Shift Allowance, London Weighting etc.).Working Tax Credits, Child Tax Credits, Child Benefit as outlined in the Benefits section below.Pensions (we will require either the latest bank statement or latest P60 to evidence the income).War Widows Pension - we will require either the latest bank statement or latest P60 to evidence income.Armed Forces Compensation Scheme, Armed Forces Independent Payment, or Survivors Guaranteed Income Payment (we will require the latest months bank statement to evidence the income).Maintenance – Spousal and child maintenance are both acceptable if evidenced by either 3 months bank statements, the court order or the latest child maintenance service letter plus the latest months bank statements evidencing the corresponding maintenance payment.Universal Credits (excluding Housing Benefit element).

Variable Income
We can accept variable income, e.g. bonus, overtime, commission, as part of the affordability assessment.
If the evidence provided shows that the income is regular over a 12 month period then we can include 100% of the income in the assessment.
Where evidence shows the income is irregular, 50% will be included. However, if 2 years evidence can be provided to prove sustainability then we may be able to include this at 100%.
More Than One Source of Employment
If the applicant has more than one source of employment, e.g. a second job, we need to ensure that the total number of hours included in the affordability assessment are sustainable. We will therefore consider the following, subject to the applicant being employed by each employer for a minimum of 6 months:
Applicant employed for a combined total of up to 40 hours a week – we will include 100% of the income in the affordability assessment.Applicant employed for a combined total of more than 40 hours per week – we will include 100% of the income for the first 40 hours and 50% of the remainder up to a maximum of 60 hours in total in the affordability assessment.
Restricted Stock Units
Documentation must be provided to prove that the Restricted Stock Units have vested both within the last 12 months and in the current financial year, and will continue to vest for a meaningful period of time (at least 12 months). Restricted Stock Units will be included as 50% in the affordability assessment, irrespective of whether they are regular or non-regular.
Rental income
For Residential Applications 100% of the UK Land and Property figure minus the finance costs from the latest years SA302 can be used as income.
We will require:
Latest 2 years SA302s.Latest months evidence of rental income (i.e. bank statement or invoice from letting agent).
Benefits
Universal Credits (UC) (Excluding Housing benefit) - we will require 3 months UC statements and latest months bank statement evidencing the income. Please note, any savings held by your client(s) may impact the amount of Universal Credit payment they are entitled to, please refer to [Universal Credit: What Universal Credit is - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit) for further information and the current Government guidelines.Working Tax Credits, Child Tax Credits, Disability Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payment, Carers Allowance, Employment Support Allowance, Attendance Allowance, Adult Disability Payment (Scotland), Child Disability Payment (Scotland) - we will require the latest DWP statement/documentation and latest months bank statement evidencing the incomeChild Benefit (CHB) – we will require the latest months bank statement evidencing the income. Child Benefit will only be accepted where the total gross earned income of each applicant is no more than £60,000, where the total gross earned income of any applicant is above £60,000 we will not accept child benefit for underwriting purposes.
Please note: if the benefit income is in joint names and the other party is not named on the mortgage application, then the income cannot be used for affordability purposes. This is also the case when the other party is a Non-Borrowing Occupier.
Where acceptable benefit income is greater than the total acceptable earned income the benefit income will be capped at the earned amount.
SIPP Pensions
For income purposes, up to 4% of the SIPP Pension pot value can be accepted as the customers annual pension income.
The customer does not need to be drawing down any income from the SIPP Pension pot at the time of the application, however the customer will need to be aged 55 or over, at the time of application, in order to use 4% as income.
If the customer is already currently taking an income from their SIPP Pension pot at a greater rate than 4%, this can be used as income providing the SIPP Pension pot value at the time of application can support that level of annual withdrawal over the term of the mortgage.
Evidence of the SIPP Pension pot value will be required when the application is submitted.
Investment Income
For [Lending Into Retirement](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria/a-z-lending-criteria/a-z-lending-criteria-residential) purposes only Investment Portfolios, Stocks and Shares, Cash ISAs and other similar investment vehicles are acceptable - 4% of the value can be used for affordability. The value of the investment must be in sterling.
Parental leave
For applicants currently on parental leave where they will be returning to work on the same terms, the applicant must confirm directly to us that they wish to use the income from the last payslip prior to parental leave (this must be provided along with the latest payslip).
For applicants currently on parental leave where they will be returning to work on different terms, we will issue a letter directly to the employer asking them to confirm the agreed return to work date, together with the applicant’s expected salary details on return to work. Alternatively, the applicants return to work information (salary details and return date) can be confirmed by a letter from the employer.
Once we have the confirmed salary information, as per the above requirements, this can be used in the income calculation.
Nurses
For a nurse, the 6 months continuous employment period starts from when they become qualified and in employment, not from when they began working on the wards and earning a bursary.
Pay rises
For applicants with a pending pay rise we require a letter from their employer confirming the date of the pay rise together with details of the new salary. The pay rise must be provided by the same employer and be effective within 3 months of the date of the employers letter. The confirmed increased salary can then be used in the affordability assessment. In instances where concerns exist with regards to the validity or reasonability of the pay rise, the underwriters may determine that the case cannot proceed until the pay rise has come into effect.
Statutory sick pay
Statutory sick pay can be included within the overall acceptable income provided that this does not amount to more than 25% of the overall monthly income, as evidenced via the latest payslip.
UK nationals working overseas
Where an application is received from a UK national working overseas, the following criteria must be met:
Income must be evidenced via UK HMRC documentation for a minimum of 1 year (e.g. SA302, P60).A minimum 2 years history in the same line of work is required.Dependents of the applicant must reside in the property full time.Applicant must maintain residency rights in the UK.Any income being used within the affordability calculation and/or to make monthly mortgage payments must be received in £sterling by the applicant (IOM£/Gibraltar£ are also acceptable).

### Income Booster (JBSP)

Income Booster (also referred to as Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor or JBSP) is a type of mortgage where not all parties to the mortgage are legal owners of the property. For example, if there are two borrowers in the scenario both will be mortgage borrowers and liable for the full mortgage, but only one will be named on the title deeds of the property. This may provide an alternative affordable option for your clients as it allows another party, such as parents, guardians, friends or family, to join the mortgage so that their income can be used when assessing the case.
Income Booster is available for new purchases, customers changing from a standard mortgage to a Income Booster mortgage or for the remortgage of an existing Income Booster mortgage. The following criteria applies:
Permitted for residential lending only. Not available for Second Home purchase, Discounted or Family Purchases or Buy To Let and not acceptable in conjunction with any other lending schemes e.g. Shared OwnershipThe maximum LTV is 95% (subject to our standard lending criteria)We will accept up to four applicants and up to all four incomes. Where there are more than two applicants, supporting borrowers can reside in different householdsThere are no restrictions around the relationship between the main borrower (proprietor) and the supporting borrower (non-proprietor)The main borrower(s) must reside in the propertyNormal age and [Lending Into Retirement](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria/a-z-lending-criteria/a-z-lending-criteria-residential) criteria applies, however on a referral basis we may allow the supporting borrower to go to a maximum age of 80 if the following applies:the current age of the supporting borrower is less than 70the main occupying borrower can support the majority of the mortgage in their own rightthe application is on a Capital Repayment basis
Applications would generally be expected on a Capital Repayment basis. However, where the requested repayment method is Interest Only, sale of the non-proprietor's residence will not be accepted as a repayment vehicleIndependent Legal Advice is required for all non-proprietorsAny product can be selected from our core residential range, including products with cashback included and products with free standard legal fees for r[eMortgages](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/emortgages/) (subject to product availability)Remortgage capital raising is acceptable (subject to our standard lending policy), but any additional monies raised must be for the proprietor’s sole and full benefit (an exception may be made if the application is for a transfer of equity to buy out the non-proprietor's share if currently on the property title).

### Lending Into Retirement

For residential lending, if the selected mortgage term means that your client will either be on or past their 71st birthday or their elected retirement age (whichever is reached first), evidence of retirement income (for example pension, investment income etc.) is required to enable us to consider the impact of retirement on affordability.
Any retirement income that is being used within the affordability assessment must be received in GBP by the applicant (IOM£ / Gibraltar£ are also acceptable). Where concerns exist with regards affordability, the application will be declined.
Depending on the circumstances, the affordability assessment will be carried out as detailed below:
Retirement is less than ten years away
Your client will need to provide proof of their projected retirement income, as well as their current earned income. The lower of the two will then be used for the affordability assessment.
If your client is within 10 years of retirement but the mortgage term will not take them to or past their 71st birthday or their elected retirement age, (whichever is reached first), then it is not considered as [Lending Into Retirement](#lending-into-retirement) and our normal affordability assessment will apply.
Retirement is ten or more years away and the term is over five years into retirement
If the term takes your client over five years into retirement, an additional assessment will be carried out to ensure the loan is affordable in the retirement period. Evidence of project retirement income must be provided so an assessment can be made that the mortgage is affordable into retirement.
Retirement is ten or more years away and the term ends within five years into retirement
We will request evidence that contributions to a pension fund are in place to support retirement. For example, evidence provided could be a pension deduction on a payslip, confirmation via the Accountant’s Certificate or confirmation from you as the broker.

### Locum Medical Professionals

For Locum medical professionals (including Bank Nurses) we will require the following:
Minimum of 2 years in their chosen professionCopy of current contract (where available)Copy of latest month’s bank statement.3 months invoices or payslips.
To calculate income we will then use an average of the last 3 months payments.
There is no minimum income requirement.
We will consider up to 2 contracts running concurrently equating up to a maximum of 40 hours per week.

### Professional Sportspersons

The mortgage term is limited to the sportspersons 35th birth year, unless they can provide evidence of their earning potential (e.g. via appropriate coaching badges etc.) after this time.
UK Sport Lottery Funds are generally not acceptable, although exceptions may be considered if the earning potential post playing career is comparable to the level of funding.
DLA/Universal Credit are generally acceptable (as they are likely to be long term funding).

### Rental Income

If your client receives rental income, we will accept 100% of the UK Land & Property figure minus finance costs as shown on the latest SA302 as additional income.
To evidence this we will require:
Latest 2 years SA302s

However, if the latest year's figures are lower then the lower figure will be used.

Group/Holding Structures are excluded for the ‘Share’ of net profit calculation and will be assessed using the standard director remuneration and dividend calculation (an average of last two years or latest year if lower).
If net profit over the last 2 years has significantly reduced or increased, we will examine the reasons why and may request more information if required.

To calculate income please use an average of the latest 2 years' share of profit, unless the latest year's figure is lower in which case the lower figure should be used.

## Property

### Tenure

All flats and maisonettes must be leasehold (feuhold in Scotland) with a minimum unexpired term of 85 on completion of the mortgage.
Leasehold flats where the borrower will also own a share in a management company that owns the freehold are acceptable.
Freehold flats are not acceptable. The only exception to this is the purchase of freehold flats in Scarborough. Tyneside flats where there are reciprocating lease / freehold arrangements are also acceptable.
Commonhold properties are not acceptable to lend on, by the Society.

### Title Restrictions and Section 106 Agreements

#### Restrictive Covenants - Section 106 Agreements

For title restrictions, the Society will typically accept the following types:

* salary/occupational restrictions
* locality restrictions
* discounted purchase price (LTV will be calculated based on the lower purchase price and not the market value)
* a combination of the above.

However, acceptance by the Society is subject to one (or more) of the following:

* any restriction must only apply to the first transaction (i.e. the initial purchase transaction)
* there must be a cascade mechanism is in place that commences after a maximum of 3 months from the date of possession, with no restriction of any kind after 6 months from the date of possession
* there must be a Mortgage Exclusion Clause in place which applies immediately upon possession and will continue to be in force for successors in title to the mortgagee ensuring that all successors also take free from the relevant restrictions.

Any restrictions should be disclosed within the application to ensure the Society's valuer is fully informed in their assessment of the property.

Any clauses/restrictions other than those listed above will result in the application being declined.

#### Overage Clause

An overage agreement is where the vendor has registered a clause against the title of the property that stipulates, they will receive a % of any increase in value once it has been sold on. This is usually triggered if planning permission is granted on the property, but the terms will be specific for each case.

The Society does not lend on any properties where there is an overage clause attached to the title and such applications will be declined.

### Unencumbered Property

If the property to be mortgaged is unencumbered then we may need to carry out additional checks to confirm the ownership of the property as part of the application process. This may include asking your client(s) to visit a local Skipton Building Society branch with suitable photo ID documentation or Skipton Building Society instructing a valuer to visit the property to carry out a standard valuation. 
The Underwriter will assess the case and advise you if any additional checks are required. We won’t charge for a valuation for mortgage purposes where the property value is less than £1.5 million. If the property is worth more than this then your client(s) will be required to pay a top up fee. There may also be some additional travel fees for your client to pay if the property is off the mainland or in a remote location. 
If your client is capital raising against their unencumbered property then we would process this as a remortgage application and your client would be eligible for any product from our current remortgage range. Where the property is unencumbered it must have been owned for a minimum of 6 months.

### Valuation Fee Scale

[View our current Valuation Fee Scale](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/submitting-cases/fees/) for full details.

### Valuation Information

* We aim to instruct a valuation within 24 hours of the application being submitted. The type of valuation instructed will be the most suitable for the application, taking into consideration property type, LTV, etc and will be solely for the purposes of assessing the security property for mortgage purposes. This may be an AVM, Desktop or standard mortgage valuation.
* Connells act as the Society's panel managers and deal with maintenance of the panel together with the allocation of all instructions. A Panel Valuer that covers the security postcode area is always used
* Some products may qualify for a free valuation. This is up to a maximum purchase price/estimated valuation of £1,500,000. Please refer to the specific product details for further information, there may be some additional travel fees if the property is located off the mainland or in a remote location.
* A valuation instructed for Additional Borrowing purposes is free to the Customer, irrespective of the type of report obtained by the Society
* The minimum acceptable property value is £50,000
* Valuations are valid for 12 months from the date appearing on the valuation report or transcript report
* The Society does not accept re-type valuations except on Scottish cases, where a transcript is requested. If more than 3 months old, we will require a refresh before the transcript will be requested
* The Society will instruct a valuation for mortgage purposes only
* The Customer can request a RICS Home Survey Level 2 or a RICS Home Survey Level 3 but they would need to arrange this directly with Connells. Connells will provide a discount for cases proceeding with the Society, the customer should contact [Connells](tel:01525218619) (01525 218619) to benefit from this service. Your client needs to confirm their application is with Skipton Building Society and quote their mortgage application number, Skipton customers can expect to receive a minimum discount of 28%. Requesting a RICS home survey Level 2 or Level 3 will not delay the mortgage offer.

For flats within commercial/retail outlets a standard valuation will be carried out and the decision to lend will be made on whether the valuer recommends we proceed. The recommendation will be subject to the valuer believing the property is suitable security for a mortgage and will be easily re-saleable. The valuer's decision is final: no challenges will be accepted, and no refunds of valuations fees will be issued if the decision is a decline.
Freehold flats are not acceptable. The only exception to this is the purchase of freehold flats in Scarborough. Tyneside flats where there are reciprocating lease/freehold arrangements are also acceptable.

### Ground Rent and Service Charges

Ground rent and other service charges must always remain at a reasonable level during the lease term. The ground rent must not exceed more than 0.1% of the property value/purchase price (whichever is lower) at the time of the application and there must be a minimum period of 10 years between any ground rent increases.
It is acceptable if the ground rent escalation is linked to the Retail Price Index (RPI) or other similar index. Compounded PRI increases are not acceptable.
Clauses providing for ground rent increases that ‘double’ (or more) the preceding level are not acceptable.
A ground rent clause which allows the ground rent charge to exceed £250 p.a. outside the M25 or exceed £1,000 p.a. inside the M25 is not acceptable unless a deed of lease variation can be obtained. If this isn’t possible then we can consider accepting a suitable indemnity insurance policy to protect our interests.

### Maximum Acreage

The maximum acceptable acreage is 3 acres. Consideration of up to 10 acres may be made by exception, subject to surveyors’ inspection and recommendation based on residential use only and ‘modest’ outbuildings (e.g. some stables/loose boxes/tack room/feed store/small hay store/small workshop/normal garaging). Any property with large commercial style agricultural buildings and/or acreage over 10 acres will not be accepted.

### New Build

Any property being sold for occupation for the first time which has been newly built or converted within the last 3 calendar years will be defined as a New Build property.
New Build homes are acceptable for residential purposes providing the build is completed within 12 months of the Societies 1st mortgage offerSubject to meeting the above requirement properties bought off plan are acceptable (this only applies to new residential applications, properties bought off plan are not acceptable for BTL)We accept residential applications up to 95% LTV for New Build propertiesOur [Track Record Mortgage](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria/track-record-mortgage/) can be used to borrow up to 100% LTV for a New Build home (additional eligibility criteria applies).
*If Incentives apply the maximum LTV may be reduced, please refer to New Build Incentives section for more details.

### New Build - BUILDING CERTIFICATES

For properties built within the last 10 years, a suitable certificate/guarantee must be available. The following new home warranty schemes are acceptable:
ABC+AdvantageAedis Warranties Limited (HomeProof)Ark Insurance Group LimitedBLP (Building Life Plans)Build Assure/FMB InsuranceBuild ZoneCADISCastle 10 CheckmateGlobal Home Warranties LimitedInternational Construction Warranties (ICW)LABCNHBCOne GuaranteePremier GuaranteeProtekThe Q Policy for Residential Properties, Bespoke Properties & Completed PropertiesThomas Miller Specialist Construction.
If the property does not have the benefit of a new home warranty scheme, we require a Professional Consultant Certificate. Where a Professional Consultant's Certificate is accepted in place of a new home warranty scheme, these are only acceptable on small scale developments i.e. those consisting of 15 residential units or less (either houses or residential flats).

### New Build INCENTIVES

Definition of Incentives:
Builders may offer sales incentives to potential buyers to encourage them to purchase their property.An incentive is anything the builder gives or provides to the buyer in cash or goods. Typical examples are deposits (i.e. builders deposits) paid before completion and cash paid after completion - often to pay stamp duty or legal fees.As all incentives must be paid for by the builder, they can be regarded as a less transparent alternative to reducing the sale price.
Assessment of Incentives
Financial incentives of up to 5% of the purchase price or valuation (whichever is the lower) are allowed on New Build properties only and are permitted on any New Build. Any application where the financial incentive value exceeds 5% will be declined, regardless of the LTV.
The financial incentive % may affect the maximum LTV allowable, as explained below:
Where the financial incentive amount is <= 2% then there is no impact on the maximum LTV allowed.Where the financial incentive amount is >2% (up to a maximum of 5%) then the maximum LTV will be reduced by 5%. For example, if the maximum LTV normally allowed was 95%, but the property had an incentive >2% then the maximum LTV available for that case would be reduced to 90%.
The Customer must be able to provide a minimum of a 5% deposit (a builder deposit can be accepted in addition to this but not in place of the customer’s own deposit). The only exception to the above is [Track Record Mortgage](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria/track-record-mortgage/). As the minimum LTV must be over 95% to be eligible for [Track Record Mortgage](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria/track-record-mortgage/), financial incentives of more than 2% are not accepted for this product.
Evidence
All incentives must be declared at DIP stage. The UK Finance Disclosure of Incentives form (formally CML incentive form) is required by the valuer, which provides details and value of any incentives.Valuers take incentives into account when preparing the valuation report. Please note that all lending is always subject to a satisfactory valuation for mortgage purposes.We will work off the lower of the valuation or the purchase price.Evidence of the deposit may be requested at application stage.
The Society does not accept applications where:
The builders/vendors are paying above market value for a part exchange property.The application has any form of Vendor (Private Seller) deposit funding.

### Non-Standard Construction Types

When considering applications for properties built using a Non-standard construction type, in addition to the information given below, all lending decisions will be subject to valuer’s comments and the valuer confirming that the property is suitable for mortgage purposes.
Prefabricated reinforced concrete (PRC)
Applications on these properties are considered only if the property is:
previously covered by an existing guarantee from PRC Homes Ltd, a former subsidiary of NHBC; orhas been repaired in accordance with a scheme originally licensed by PRC Homes Ltd; oralready/previously covered by a similar guarantee provided by a local authority or other public body where the property is owned by that authority; orthe property has been repaired to a minimum grade 5 standard under the NTHAS (non-traditional homes appraisal scheme)the Applicant intends to ensure such a guarantee will be in force prior to release of any part of the advance; orany other dwellings within the same block have been similarly improved under an approved scheme.all paperwork is contemporaneous with the works undertaken (retrospective warranties etc. are not acceptable).
* With specific regard to Airey Houses, PRC Homes Ltd issued a licence on 12th March 1987 to Leeds City Council for a repair system to these types of dwellings. Houses repaired under this licence are, in principle, acceptable to the Society, provided the works were carried out after 12th March 1987.
Prefabricated reinforced concrete properties that have not been repaired are not acceptable to the Society.
No-fines Construction
Wimpey no-fines construction and Laing Easiform construction (built post 1945) are generally acceptable and in each case suitability for lending purposes will be dependent on the valuer’s comments.
Steel Frame Construction
We do not generally accept steel frame dwellings unless a structural engineer's report (of the steel frame) is obtained and all recommended work within that report is carried out and the mortgage valuer confirms that the property is suitable for mortgage purposes. (A structural engineer's report is essential as a valuer is not able to ascertain the condition of the steel framework merely by carrying out a mortgage valuation).
The above criteria does not apply to newly built blocks of flats.
Timber Frame dwellings
Timber frame dwellings built prior to 1965 are unacceptable with the exception of listed period buildings.
Large Panel Systems (LPS)
We do not lend on properties of this type of construction.
Space4 System
Space4 is a designated Modern Method of Construction (MMC).
This is generally acceptable and in each case suitability for lending purposes will be dependent on the valuer’s comments.
Single Skin Construction
The Society will only allow a small portion of the property to be constructed of single skin which must only be one storey in height and subject to satisfactory comments from the valuer.
Modern Modular Steel Frame with Brick Externally
These are typically new build construction types and should generally be acceptable given that the NHBC guarantee is in place, subject to valuers’ comments.
Mundic Block
Properties in areas where "mundic" is a known problem (properties build from concrete blocks laid onto mass concrete foundations) must be subject to a screening test in line with RICS guidance. A result of Class A1, A2 or A3 is required for a property to be considered acceptable.
BOPAS Scheme
Properties under this scheme should generally be acceptable subject to valuation and a 10-year warranty being in place.

### Solar Panels/Wind Turbines/Biomass Boilers

The Society does not apply any restrictions in relation to any of the above.

### TSM (Transfer Subject to Mortgage) Table

TSM policy relates to existing SBS borrowers only, where a request is made to either change the names on the existing mortgage (i.e. remove & / or add a name) and in some cases where also additional funds are requested to buy out a partner etc.
Acceptable Valuation Types:
LTV up to & including 60%: The Society will assess the case against the original file valuation (index linked).LTV 61%-75%: An AVM is acceptable subject to standard AVM acceptable criteriaLTV over 75%: Up To Date report required. Where only an AVM is on file or if the valuation report on file is over 5 years old then a full standard report will be required.
Free Valuation/Free Legal Type Rules
A TSM application may not qualify for free valuation or free legal fees. The application will be processed as a remortgage purely as a result of internal system restrictions. Additional funds can be raised to pay ex-partner and this can be raised on the same product or any product from the current range. Normal lending criteria applies; cases outside of policy should be referred to the MSC for consideration by a Lending Manager. Justification and evidence of affordability must be obtained prior to referral.
If the application does not qualify for free legal fees the customer can choose to use Skipton Home Conveyancing Scheme (SHCS) and pay the fees. We will debit the fees for the standard legal work to the mortgage account on completion and the elevated service part will be invoiced by CDPL to the customer directly. The advantage to the customer is that the fee for the standard legal work is very competitive, although it is important to note that the fees may differ dependent on area, i.e. England, Scotland etc

### Trust Arrangements

The Society does not accept Trust arrangements in favour of any person or body who is not a party to the mortgage.

## Policy

### Additional Borrowing

If your client has an existing mortgage with us and they want to borrow more, for example to carry out home improvements, then they can apply for an additional borrowing loan.
Additional Borrowing for business purposes is not acceptable.
A minimum additional borrowing loan amount of £10,000 applies in most circumstances.
If the additional borrowing is for green home improvements (subject to product availability, 50%+ of the additional borrowing must be for green home improvements) or for Shared Ownership (where the loan is to be used for staircasing) or for debt consolidation (where the whole loan is to be used for debt consolidation) then a minimum loan amount of £5,000 is acceptable.
Affordability is calculated on the total new loan amount, not just the additional borrowing.
Where funds are being requested for Green home improvements, quotes and estimates will be required to cover the full amount of the improvements.
Additional Borrowing is allowed up to a maximum LTV of 95%, except for debt consolidation where the maximum LTV is 85% and capital raising where a maximum LTV of 75% applies. The maximum LTV includes the current balance & the proposed additional loan.
Your client must have made six months' consecutive mortgage payments before applying for Additional Borrowing. Your client must not have had any mortgage or secured arrears in the last six months or have exceeded two missed months mortgage payments in the last two years.
Additional Borrowing for debt consolidation purposes is subject to a minimum loan of £5,000, a maximum loan of £50,000 and a total maximum LTV of 85%. Debt consolidation applications are not acceptable where the repayment method is Interest Only or if your client has already received an additional borrowing loan for debt consolidation purposes from the Society within the last 3 years. When assessing debt consolidation applications, 50% of the debt balance that is to be repaid with the Additional Borrowing will be factored in as an ongoing commitment as part of the Underwriting process.
You can submit an Additional Borrowing application for your client through [eMortgages](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/emortgages/), it’s a single stage application process as a Decision In Principle (DIP) is not required.

### Affordability

The affordability model estimates household expenditure so the mortgage payment under stressed interest rates has to be less than or equal to the Effective Disposable Income (EDI). Any applications not meeting this criteria will be declined.
Any income (employed or self employed) being used within the affordability calculation and/or to make the monthly mortgage payments must be received in £Sterling by the applicant.
At DIP stage the affordability assessment is based on the commitments declared. All current outstanding loans & credit commitments must be declared, any not disclosed may potentially affect the affordability assessment at full mortgage application stage (FMA) and may result in the application being declined.
The following must also be confirmed;
maintenance / child supporttuition feesnursery/childcare costsrent (where remaining on completion)service chargeground rentshared ownership rentestate rentcharge.
The affordability model includes an element for pension contributions. However, if you believe that the customer is paying into a scheme where you would deem the payments to be higher than standard and they are unable to opt out, please highlight this on the DIP as per the first bullet point below.
In addition, the following must be disclosed at DIP stage:-
Details of any other outgoings, regular or otherwise which are likely to affect the ability to meet the monthly mortgage paymentsDetails of any potential changes to income now or in the foreseeable future that are likely to affect the ability to meet the monthly mortgage payment
To carry out an assessment of income and expenditure to establish the maximum that can be borrowed please use [our online Affordability Calculator](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/calculators/affordability-calculator/).
If LTV required is >95%, additional eligibility criteria applies, for further details please refer to [Track Record Mortgage](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria/track-record-mortgage/)

### Airbnb

Applications where any element of the security address is being let via Airbnb and/or similar schemes are not acceptable and will be declined.

### Capital Raising

Capital raising up to 75% LTV is generally acceptable, however the following reasons for capital raising are unacceptable:
Purchase of time sharesCurrency speculationPurchase of stocks and sharesPayment of tax bills including inheritance taxBusiness purposesDebt consolidation
Capital raising over 75% LTV is only acceptable for the following reasons:
Home improvements*Transfer of EquityStaircasingRepaying HTB loanRepay a secured charge
* please note we reserve the right to request estimates and evidence of planning permission for major home improvements.

### Choosing a Solicitor

If the conveyancer the borrower chooses is on the Society’s panel, we will instruct them jointly.
If the conveyancer the borrower chooses is not on the Society’s panel, the Society will instruct a separate conveyancer to act for it, and two sets of costs may be incurred, for which the borrower will be liable.
The Society does not allow separate representation except where we have instructed our own solicitor to act for the Society. This is in line with the CML Handbook which states: Our instructions are personal to the firm to whom they are addressed and must be dealt with solely by that firm. The conveyancer must not subcontract or assign our instructions to another firm or body, nor may they accept instructions to act for us from another body. If this requirement is not complied with, it may result in the offer being withdrawn until proper instructions from the Society can be given to it’s own chosen firm or body.

### Deposit

Where a deposit is being used towards the purchase of the property we may ask for proof of deposit if we deem that necessary.
A Non-borrowing Occupier cannot provide or contribute to the deposit, they must be named on the mortgage.
Deposits from a non-UK source may be acceptable. We will require 6 months' bank statements detailing the original source of the funds and the transfer into the applicant’s UK bank account together with a completed [International Deposit form](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria/a-z-lending-criteria/a-z-lending-criteria-residential) [PDF]. Please note, where the deposit originates from China, the maximum deposit acceptable from that source is £30,000.
If some or all the deposit is being gifted, full details must be provided at application stage before we make the decision to lend, please refer to Gifted Deposit for further details.
Vendor deposit funding, deposit funds raised through unsecured lending or deposit funds sourced from a child’s savings account are not acceptable.
Where any of the circumstances surrounding the deposit do not meet our lending criteria requirements the application may be declined.

### Direct Debits

It is a condition of our Mortgage Offer that mortgage payments are made by Direct Debit, in line with the Direct Debit Guarantee.
The Direct Debit payment will be requested by the Society from the customer's nominated bank account on the 1st of the month however the payment may not debit the customer's bank account for up to 3 working days afterwards. This is due to the time it takes for the Direct Debit to be processed after the Society has requested the payment and instances where the 1st of the month falls over a weekend and/or a bank holiday.
Whilst the direct debit payment may not debit the customer's account for approximately 3 working days after the payment date it is important that the customer has sufficient funds in their account from this point.

### Family Discounted Purchase

The following criteria applies where the applicant is purchasing a property from a relative at a discounted purchase price:
The Society will lend up to 100% of the discounted purchase priceNo personal deposit is required from your clientLoan To Value (LTV) is restricted to a maximum of 95% of the open market valueAdditional funds can be raised for home improvements at the time of purchase providing the total loan does not exceed 75% of the open market valueNo capital raising for any other purposes is acceptable.
The Vendor must be a relative of the applicant as defined by the Family Law Act 1996, which includes:
ParentGrandparentChildSibling
(All of the above includes the "step" equivalent)

### First Homes England Scheme

The First Homes England scheme allows first time buyers, where eligible, to purchase a qualifying property with a discount of 30%, 40% or 50% on full market value. The discount is determined by the local authority based on local need – so higher discounts may be needed more in high property value areas.
To qualify for the scheme the household income must not exceed £80,000 (£90,000 in Greater London). The local authority may set a lower income cap if they can evidence that this is needed.
The local authority may also apply a local connection test based on residency, employment in the local area, family connections or special circumstances such as caring responsibilities. They may also prioritise key workers, (as defined by the local authority), for the scheme.
The First Time Buyers will also need to have a mortgage (or home purchase plan) in place for a minimum of 50% of the discounted purchase value.
Maximum property value (after the discount is applied) is £250,000 (£420,000 in London). The price cap only applies to the initial sale of a new build property and not to future sales in the second-hand market.
The discount is maintained on the property in perpetuity, so when the property is sold on it will be sold with the same discount and on the same terms as the original sale, allowing the next first homes customer to benefit from the discount.

### Forces Help To Buy

Forces Help To Buy (FHTB) is a government scheme allowing armed services personnel to borrow up to 50% of their salary by way of an interest-free employer loan (up to a maximum of £25,000) which is then used to fund the deposit for house purchase and other associated costs, such as Solicitors fees. The interest free employer loan is then repaid over a ten year term via the applicant’s monthly salary.
Applications on the FHTB scheme are acceptable for residential lending and any product from our current residential range can be selected, subject to the LTV required.
A copy of the Personal Information Note (PIN) from the MOD will be required as part of the mortgage application for all purchase cases. The PIN is a letter issued by the MOD confirming the applicant meets qualifying criteria and sets out the terms of the loan requested.
The Forces Help To Buy scheme can be used in conjunction with other schemes, e.g. Right To Buy, Shared Ownership, etc. We will also consider FHTB remortgage applications.

### Gifted Deposit

If some or all the funds being provided towards the purchase of the property are not being provided directly by the applicants and you are aware these are being provided as a gift, then full details must be disclosed when the application is submitted.
We do not accept gifted deposits from anyone who is or will be a non-borrowing occupier of the property to be mortgaged.
Gifted deposits from a non-UK source may be acceptable. We will require 6 months' bank statements detailing the original source of the funds and the transfer into the applicant’s UK bank account together with a completed [International Deposit form](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria/a-z-lending-criteria/a-z-lending-criteria-residential) [PDF].
If the gifted deposit exceeds £500,000 additional documentation will be required, regardless of whether the gifted amount originated from a UK or a non-UK source.
For all gifted deposits the giftor providing the funds must be a relative of the applicant as defined by the Family Law Act 1996. A signed gifted deposit declaration is required from the giftor before completion. All giftors must be aged 18 years or over and cannot reside in the property.

We automatically attempt to electronically verify every applicant’s ID and income when the application is submitted, this means that our document requirements may vary for each applicant.
If your case is submitted correctly packaged it will mean that it can be fully underwritten within our service levels, providing a quick and efficient service for you and your client.
Photographs of supporting documents are acceptable, with the exception of Personal and Address ID documents. For further guidance please refer to our [Acceptable Documents](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria/a-z-lending-criteria/a-z-lending-criteria-residential) [PDF].

### Mortgage Offer Validity

Mortgage offers for non-new build properties are valid for 6 months from the date of the first mortgage offer. After 6 months the Society may consider extending the offer but this will be subject to an up to date credit search and up to date income and affordability checks. A new application will be required if it is 12 months from the original offer date.
For new build properties the offer validity period is 9 months with the option to extend for a further 3 months subject to an up to date credit search and affordability assessment being carried out. A re-valuation may also be required. The completion of the build must take place within 12 months from the date of the original offer, if the property build is not complete within this time then the offer will lapse and a new application will be required.
Offer extensions will not be granted where there is a materially adverse change in any of the following:
the quality of the applicationthe customers financial circumstances (ability to repay)the valuation of the property.

### Mortgage Term

The maximum Mortgage Term available depends on the repayment type required, as detailed below:
40 years for Capital & Interest mortgages25 years for Interest Only or Part & Part mortgages

### Non Occupying Borrowers

Permitted for residential lending only. Applications are not permitted on Buy To Let, Discounted or Family Purchase, or in conjunction with any other type of specialist lending, (e.g. Shared Ownership, Right To Buy, Help To Buy)
Normal LTV limits apply.
Maximum four applicants.
Independent Legal Advice is required for all non-occupying borrowers.
For applications where the term takes any applicant into retirement - standard [Lending Into Retirement](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/criteria/a-z-lending-criteria/a-z-lending-criteria-residential) (LIR) policy applies.
Applications would generally be expected on a capital repayment basis. However, where the requested repayment method is interest only the non-occupying borrower's residence will not be accepted as a repayment vehicle.

### Non-Borrowing Occupier

Forms of Consent are required in all cases where the loan is in a sole name & there is a non borrowing occupier (NBO). Except where the occupier is:
Under the age of 17.The child / stepchild of the borrower & aged 17 - 25 & in full time education at the time of application.
Independent legal advice is strongly recommended where there is an NBO residing in the property. Where independent legal advice is recommended and subsequently taken then that condition must be adhered to in all cases with a solicitor/conveyancer acting as a solicitor. This may incur a fee which is payable by the applicant.
A Non-borrowing Occupier (NBO) cannot provide or contribute towards the deposit to purchase the property. If any of the deposit is being provided by the Non-Borrowing Occupier then they must be added to the mortgage account as a mortgage borrower for the application to proceed.

### Payment Holidays and Overpayments

Payment Holidays
If the customers has made overpayments, we offer the option of payment holidays, giving them a break from mortgage payments for up to three consecutive months.
Customers can take payment holidays once they have had their mortgage with Skipton for six months, but they will need to give the Society at least 14 days prior written notice. As long as the customer has had no arrears the holiday proposed would not take the LTV of their mortgage above 95%, and there are sufficient surplus payments to cover the holiday, the customer may take up to three consecutive months' holiday.
Customers cannot take more than a total of six months in any 12 month period. Whilst payments will not be made during the holiday, interest will continue to be added to the account causing the balance to increase.
Overpayments
By making overpayments the customer could be able to pay off their mortgage earlier than originally planned saving in interest. All of our mortgage deals allow customers to repay a fixed percentage of their original mortgage balance per year without charge.
Most of our mortgage deals include Early Repayment Charges (ERCs) if overpayments are made that are more than the set overpayment allowance on the product. Full details of this showing in the Mortgage Illustration and Mortgage Offer.

### Porting

If your client is moving home and currently has a Skipton mortgage then they may be able to transfer their mortgage over to their new property, we refer to this as ‘porting’.
When porting their mortgage, your client can keep the amount they're currently borrowing the same or, if they're eligible, they could borrow more.
They could also reduce the size of their mortgage (please be aware that early repayment charges may apply).
To be eligible for porting, the purchase of the new property should happen within six months of the sale of the old one. Early repayment charges (ERCs) may be payable if the sale and purchase of the two properties are not simultaneous. Your client will have six months to complete the onward purchase to receive a refund.
Mortgage porting is subject to our standard underwriting process, including criteria and affordability at the time of porting, the property itself and the purpose of the loan.
For more information and some helpful FAQs please see [our dedicated Porting page](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/submitting-cases/porting/).

### Product Transfers

Product Transfer requests can be submitted up to three months in advance of the product maturity date.

The account is in arrearsA 'Consent to Let' exists on the accountIt’s an Interest Only mortgage account and your client wishes to make a contract variation as well as completing a product transfer.
The above won't automatically prevent your client from switching their mortgage product, it just means they would need to go through the product transfer process directly with us as the required functionality isn’t currently available on our [eMortgages](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/emortgages/) system.
Your client will be eligible for any products from our remortgage range as well as our existing customer only range, these products will be available on your product sourcing systems.
You may be able to accept the Product Transfer on behalf of your client as part of the [eMortgages](https://www.skipton-intermediaries.co.uk/emortgages/) process. This means we may not require the relevant forms to be submitted with a customer wet signature if all the following apply:
You have supplied all applicants with a copy of the MIL/Offer documentYou have explicit consent from all the applicants to accept the new product on their behalf (and you keep a copy of this consent on your file)You have ensured that all applicants understand the terms and conditions of the product

If we don’t receive the required documentation in time and fully signed, we will be unable to process the Product Transfer (contract variation) and you will have to start the process again. In this circumstance the availability of the product you originally selected cannot be guaranteed.
Amending or Cancelling Product Transfers
If you need to amend or cancel a product transfer, even if it’s to resubmit on a new product, please action these changes directly through our eMortgage system.
There may be some cases, such as accounts with different maturity dates or additional requirements, where you are unable to cancel the product transfer and you will receive an error message. In these instances, please call our Broker Support Team on 0345 601 6683 and they will be happy to help.

However, serving members of the British Armed Forces serving overseas or at a base further than 50 miles or 90 minutes travelling time automatically have the right to sub-let their shared ownership properties. We will require evidence of SO providers awareness/consent before we can process the Armed Forces Consent to Let.

Standard minimum submission documentation applies with the addition that for purchase SO cases, a Memorandum of Sale is required.

### Skipton Home Conveyancing Service

Remortgage Conveyancing Service
If you're moving your mortgage to Skipton but not moving home, then you won't usually have to pay anything for the legal costs involved if you elect to use our Remortgage Conveyancing Service, depending on your chosen product. In other words, it's free to you, as we pay the standard legal costs within the service.
As well as this, we pride ourselves on having a well-established relationship with our recommended conveyancers who provide the legal work for our Conveyancing Service and this helps to make the process as hassle free as possible for you.
The remortgage work is undertaken by the conveyancers on a ‘reduced title check' basis which Skipton considers is sufficient to assess its security. If for any reason you wish the conveyancers to carry out a full title check on your behalf they can do so but any additional costs involved are payable by you.
For your peace of mind, experienced and well respected firms are currently used in the Skipton Remortgage Conveyancing Service. They are regulated by the Council for Licensed Conveyancers.
Fees
Please be aware that some legal work relating to matters not usually involved in a standard remortgage are not included in this offer e.g. transfers of equity or deeds of postponement. The solicitors will offer fixed prices for certain "elevated services". Please see our Elevated Service fees leaflets for further information.

In addition to this, if the loan is above £1,000,000 additional costs may be payable. Some payments to third parties may also still have to be paid and occasionally we may offer certain products with other benefits where we do not pay the legal costs.
If you're unsure as to whether additional costs may be involved in your mortgage, please speak to your mortgage adviser in the first instance.
If at any time your remortgage falls through, then you won't have to pay any standard legal fees, but fees which relate to matters not usually involved in a remortgage may still have to be paid.
