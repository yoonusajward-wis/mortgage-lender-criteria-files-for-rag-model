## Concessionary purchase

**Key criteria:**
* A concessionary purchase will only be considered when the property is being purchased from a close family member, ie. parent, child, grandparent, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, foster parent or legal guardian (including step relatives), or from landlord by a sitting tenant.
* Loans can be considered up to 100% of the discounted purchase price, if the equity gift covers the required full deposit amount.

**Application Considerations:**
* For Landlord to tenant sales:

## Deposit

## Applicant's own funds

Evidence of deposit funds in bank account.

A non-repayable gift from a parent, child, grandparent, brother, sister, uncle/aunt, foster parent or legal guardian (including step relatives) is acceptable.

Non-monetary sales incentives, such as white goods, electrical equipment, flooring and curtains/blinds and the upgrade of kitchen/bathroom are acceptable.

## Deed of gift and transfer at undervalue

If the price being paid for the property is less than the full market value, the solicitor acting in the mortgage transaction will be asked to confirm that the property is not subject to a transfer at undervalue or a deed of gift. Deed of gift is defined as a transfer of interest in a property from the owner to another without money or other consideration being exchanged in return for that interest. If there is such a transaction taking place or has taken place within the last 5 years, the solicitor must confirm to Aldermore that an acceptable defective title indemnity will be obtained. A transfer from single to joint ownership does not require indemnity if the transfer is simultaneous with completion.

Following the deed of gift the person making the gift must not continue to reside in the property.

## Minimum income

**Minimum:** Total allowable income for applicants must be at least £10,000 per year.

## Classification

Self-employed applicants may be classified into one of four categories:
1. Sole traders
2. General Partnership
3. Director - private limited company (if 25% or greater shareholding)

* An applicant who is employed on a subcontractor basis will be classed as a sole trader
* If the applicant's shareholding of a limited company is less than 25% they will normally be classified as being an employee of the company
* Where joint applicants are directors of the same private limited company and their joint shareholding is greater than 25% of the company they will be treated as self-employed

## Evidence of income

Last 2 years Tax Calculations and corresponding HMRC Tax Year Overview documents.

Applicants with 1 year's accounting information are acceptable up to 90% LTV (excluding fees) if they can;
* Evidence previous employment in the same line of work; or
* Demonstrate guaranteed income for the next accounting period; or

## Contractor criteria

## Requirements

* A maximum of 2 contracts can be worked at the same time, subject to total hours per week being reasonable

## Income calculation

* Affordability can be assessed on a gross income / employed basis for contractors working via an umbrella company, those with a Fixed Term Contract where tax and NICs are paid at source and self-employed Limited Company Directors / sole traders where there are no other employees. Limited company directors must be the only shareholder, except where partner / spouse is the other shareholder and they are jointly applying for the mortgage
* Daily / weekly rate on the latest contract will be multiplied by 46 weeks for self-employed and other day rate contractors. For those working via an umbrella company, gross income will be considered based on income received by the contractor from the umbrella company, once 'umbrella expenses' have been removed, such as commission and employer pension
* All other cases, including those contractors working via Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) will be assessed on a self-employed basis.

## Evidence of income

* Copies of the current and previous contracts for the last 12 months will be required to confirm that contract period meets criteria

# SECTION 6 – LEGAL FEES

## For residential owner occupiers

We can use the applicant's solicitors to act on behalf of Aldermore, subject to them being on our wider panel, or by them meeting our qualification criteria to join.

Where applicant(s) choose to nominate a Conveyancer that does not qualify (or is not accepted) onto our panel, we will require separate legal representation, based on the fees detailed in our legal fees scale.

## Legal process Q&As

## How can I check if my applicant's solicitors are on your panel?

You can search for them on lender exchange, either by solicitor's name or postcode. If they appear then they're on the panel.

If they aren't on the panel, please register them before offer to prevent delays.

## Why does my client have to wait until the offer is issued before your free legal solicitor is instructed?

Our agreement with our free legal partners is that a mortgage offer is required before we contact the solicitor.

## Can you email a copy of the offer directly to my solicitors and if not why?

Our process is to send the offer to our solicitors via secure email to ensure your data is safe, our solicitors will then make contact with your solicitor and securely send them the offer document.

---

# SECTION 7 – CRITERIA Q&As

## How do you treat clients with pre-settled or settled status?

We accept clients with settled or pre-settled status and those with permanent rights to reside.

## Do you consider unpaid defaults registered over 36 months ago?

Yes, we can consider defaults registered over 36 months regardless of whether they have been settled/repaid. For defaults relating to mobile phone contracts, we can ignore them even if only recently registered.

## Can you use just one year's accounts?

If your client is experienced in their role and has only one set of accounts, we can consider up to a maximum of 90% loan to value. Please note, this only applies to our residential owner-occupied mortgages.

## If self employed income has increased from the previous year, are you able to use the latest years figures?

Yes, potentially if the accountant can confirm both a good rationale and sustainability.

## How do you work out overtime for employed income?

We use 100% of overtime or 75% of bonus income. We calculate an average for the last 3 months overtime and annualise this figure. You need to put the full figure into our calculator, and we will take 50% off in the background.
