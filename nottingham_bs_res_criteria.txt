## Lending Criteria Overview

With our soft searches and flexible criteria, let's see if we can help you with those tricky-to-place cases.

At the decision in principle (DIP) stage, we ensure our actions don't leave a 'hard' footprint on your client's credit file. This non-intrusive approach allows you to discover what you can achieve.

### Adverse Credit Criteria

| Criteria | Acceptable |
|:---------|:-----------|
| Mortgage or secured loan arrears | 2 in 24 |
| Unsecured loan arrears | 2 in 24 |
| CCJ | Single satisfied CCJ <£500 may be considered. CCJs above £500 must be satisfied for at least three years |
| Defaults | Satisfied defaults up to £250 may be considered (none for mortgage/secured/unsecured loans). Defaults >£250 must be satisfied for at least three years |
| Bankruptcy | Discharged for three years |

**Note:** We only need the discharge certificate for applicants who were previously declared bankrupt. No documents are required for all other criteria points.

### Minimum Packaging Requirements

Check our [minimum packaging guide](https://www.thenottingham.com/media/h3hnc0kw/minimum-packaging-guides.pdf) to find out what documents you need to submit with your application. This will help us provide a speedier underwriting decision.

## Affordability and Income

### Introduction

The calculator will apply deductions to gross income. It will use tax bands and NI contributions to calculate net income. We'll assess an applicant's borrowing ability using an affordability test. It will consider their income, debts and expenses. This will confirm the maximum amount we can lend.

### Employed Income

The calculator will apply deductions to gross income based on tax bands and NI contributions. It will then calculate the net income.

### Pay Rise

We'll consider a pay rise where evidence of the increase can be provided. We'll need a payslip showing the increase and a bank statement showing the new salary credit.

### Other Income We May Assess

* **Cash in hand:** where employees are paid in cash, we need to verify this by regular cash payments into the bank account.
  * We can't assess the income if corresponding payments aren't made.
* **Profit from UK Land and Property** if consistent and shown via two years SA302s minus finance costs: **100%**.
* **Regular overtime or bonus** (monthly, quarterly, six-monthly, annually - must prove regularity): **50%**.
* **Child maintenance:** **100%** subject to six months' paid evidence on bank statements.
* **Second job income:** **100%** subject to six months' track record.
* **Child Tax Credit:** **50%** (excluding childcare element).
* **Guaranteed bonus/overtime/shift allowance:** **100%**.
* **State and occupational pension:** **100%**.
* **Working Families Tax Credit:** **50%**.
* **Investment income:** not acceptable.
* **Large town allowance:** **100%**.
* **Self-employed income.**
* **Travel allowance:** **100%**.
* **Commission:** **50%**.

### Self-Employed Income

We require the applicant to have at least **three years of trading** and will ask for the last two years' SA302s and corresponding TYOs.

We'll use the latest year's trading figures, subject to the fact that there will be no more than a 20% fluctuation in the first instance.

If income fluctuates over 20%, we reserve the right to obtain a reference from a suitably qualified accountant. We want to confirm that the latest year's income is sustainable and discover why it fluctuated.

SA302 and Tax Year Overview must relate to an entire 12-month trading period. We'll consider cases where they may have incorporated from sole trader status to a limited company/partnership. We'll need at least one year's trading figures to support the change.

### Acceptable Accountant Qualifications

AAPA, FAPA, ACMA, FCMA, ACA, FCA, ACCA, CA, CPFA, FCCA, MAAT, FMAAT, CTA (Fellow), FTII (Fellow), CTA, ATII, ATT, ACPA, and FCPA.

### Commitments and Expenditure

The affordability calculator will ask for all monthly commitments and household expenditures. The household expenditure should be based on the property to be mortgaged.

We'll consider monthly credit commitments, including student loans. They must have an outstanding term of six months or longer. If not shown, we'll use 3.00% of the outstanding balances on any/all credit cards as the monthly commitment figure.

### Retirement Income

We'll accept the following retirement income:

| | Non RIO | RIO |
|:---|:--------|:-----|
| **Lending into retirement** | Defined benefits pension | Defined benefits pension |
| **Lending in retirement** | Defined benefits pension<br>Defined contribution pension | Defined benefits pension<br>Defined contribution pension (annuity only) |

### Higher Lending Charge

A higher lending charge is payable on loans above 80% LTV.

| Advance | Premium |
|:--------|:--------|
| 80.00% or below | No higher lending charge |
| 80.01% - 95.00% | We pay the higher lending charge for the borrower |
