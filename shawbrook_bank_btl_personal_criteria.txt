### Valuation Requirements

**Valuation Report:**
* **A Bank appointed valuation report** addressed to the Bank from the pre-approved panel of surveyors with sufficient PI cover must be held or an Automated Valuation Model (AVM)
* **Validity of Report:** Valuations are valid for 6 months
* **Qualifications:** Fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (FRICS) or Member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (MRICS)

**Automated Valuations (AVMs):**
* AVMs can be considered for security when the following standards are met:
  * Single-unit residential property and small HMOs valued on a single dwelling basis
  * If the purchase price is lower than the market valuation, we can ignore the AVM confidence level and apply max LTV (75%) to the purchase price
  * Maximum value £2m in London and the South-East, £1m elsewhere
  * Maximum LTV and minimum confidence levels for capital value shall be in accordance with the table below
  * England, Wales, Scotland
  * No property above or adjoining commercial premises
  * Freehold or minimum unexpired 85-years leasehold
  * No converted flats
  * Flats in blocks where no cladding is indicated
  * No new-build property built within last 24 months
  * Report is valid for 6 months
  * A maximum of 10 properties per loan
  * Available on up to 75% of the security properties on portfolio loans with more than 10 properties
  * Refer to 'Other' Section for concentration by volume requirements

**AVM Maximum LTV and Minimum Confidence Levels:**

| Max LTV | Minimum Confidence Levels (value) | Minimum Confidence Level (rental) |
|---------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 65%-75% | 4.0 – 5.0 | 4.0 |
| 55%- 64% | 3.0 – 3.9 | 4.0 |
| Up to 55% | Min 3.0 | 4.0 |

* LTV calculated against the corresponding CL (i.e., 4.2CL = 67% LTV)
* Rental Confidence between 4-4.9 requires a second automated verification

**Valuation Methodology:**

**Security Type - What value we use:**

**Single Residential (Flat/House):**
* Comparable valuation method with Open Market Value confirmed by the surveyor or an AVM

**Block of Flats (up to 10):**
* Where the property comprises individual units e.g. self-contained flats, which are capable of sale separately within a 12-month period these can be considered on an aggregated basis

**Block of Flats (11 and more):**
* The valuation will be based primarily on the capitalised rental income
* Consideration will be given to comparable sales evidence of other similar investment property

**Small HMO (up to 6 tenants):**
* If the property is being used as an HMO, but the works to convert it back to a single-family dwelling are minimal, then a single dwelling value based on direct comparable evidence will be used
* If the property has been extensively adapted to meet HMO legislation (e.g., changes to room sizes or added ensuite facilities) then the valuer may reflect a premium element to reflect the cost of works, but this will be determined by demand and the location

**Small HMO (up to 6 tenants) in an Article 4 Direction area:**
* If the property is in an area of Article 4 then a yield-based investment valuation may be appropriate considering comparable yields in the area
* Given that Article 4 Direction is in place, the property must hold C4 planning use. However, the increasing use of City-wide Article 4 directives means that the premium can be significantly diluted, if present at all

**Large HMO (7 and more tenants):**
* Will tend to be a yield-based investment valuation: valuer will consider comparable yields in the area and similar sized large houses
* Planning must be in place for the property to be used as a large HMO (Sui Generis)

**Valuation fees:** Apply as standard (varies by property value and type)
**Down valuations:** May affect loan amount or require additional deposit
