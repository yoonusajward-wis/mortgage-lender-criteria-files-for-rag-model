The borrower(s) will require independent legal advice as they are jointly and severally liable for the debt but are not owners of the property.

## L

### Large loans

The exposure to one borrower or linked individuals (where the servicing of two or more loans is economically dependent upon one individual) is limited to £5m. The following LTV limits apply to larger loans:

* Loans less than £2m won't exceed 80% LTV including arrangement fee

### Lending into retirement

We define this as cases where applicants can reasonably be expected to retire before the end of the mortgage term.

Our definition of retired is a borrower of 70 years of age or older. Anyone below that age, who will be 70 or older at the maturity of the loan, will be a lending into retirement case. Applicants who are 70 or older at the start of the loan are lending in retirement cases.

The maximum LTV for residential borrowers (interest only and capital repayment) over 68 years of age is 75%. Loans agreed prior to age 68, which are over 75% LTV at loan inception, need to have reduced to at least 75% before the borrower becomes more than 68 years of age.

### Lending in retirement

We define this as cases where borrowers are already retired at the start of the mortgage term.

The maximum age of the borrower (oldest if joint borrowers) on an owner-occupied property at the end of the mortgage term is 85. There is no maximum age for borrowers on buy to let, holiday let or short-term loans, however it must be within general life expectancy.

The maximum LTV for residential borrowers (interest only and capital repayment) over 68 years of age is 75%.

### Let to buy
