### Nonstandard construction / Modern Methods of Construction

Non-standard and Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) are not acceptable forms of construction unless Valuers consider the build type to be well tested or proven in an area and the construction scheme is BOPAS accredited.

### Property Restrictions

A property that is subject to any planning, occupancy, or resale restriction is usually not acceptable.

Where there is a strong case that saleability is not detrimentally affected, and any restriction is commensurate with the property/location the application can be considered.

In all circumstances these cases should be discussed with Intermediary Support prior to submission and full notes submitted with the case. Referrals will be required to ensure compliance with lending criteria.

### Services and Habitability

Mains electricity must be supplied to the property.

Natural water supplies are acceptable subject to local demand and saleability.

Septic tanks, private sewage systems, reed beds etc are acceptable.

Properties where there are unadopted sewers with known functional or legal issues are not acceptable.

The property must have a central heating system, wall mounted electric heating, or a district heating system. Solid fuel only heating systems are not acceptable.

The property must be immediately habitable with a functioning kitchen and washing facilities as well as working services and must be confirmed by the valuer as habitable and readily saleable.

Specific small works (completion of current repairs, improvements, re-fitting a bathroom or kitchen) can be acceptable, however the property will be valued based upon its current condition and not the 'after works' condition.

### Solar Panels

Solar panels are acceptable if they have been bought outright or subject to confirmation with the acting solicitor that if a lease exists, an adequate break clause of 6 months is in place within the terms of the lease, with no onerous/onward restrictions which could cause issues in the event of possession. Subject to satisfactory valuation report and valuer comment.

### Structural Issues

Where structural movement is evident at the property and not stated as "historic or longstanding" or there is risk of further movement considered probable, an offer cannot be considered until a structural engineer's report has been obtained, referred for comment and reviewed by the valuer.

Reports may be accepted from members of the following bodies:

* The Institution of Structural Engineers (www.IStructE.org.uk)
* Institution of Civil Engineers (www.ice.org.uk)
* The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) – Building Surveyor

If the report is not addressed to the applicant, written confirmation must be obtained from the originator that its contents may be relied upon by the applicant(s).

Ultimately, if a home cannot be insured under normal terms, it is unlikely that it can be easily sold, and existing Insurers will be notified.

Under those circumstances, the mortgage application will be declined.

### Studio Flats

Flats must have a minimum internal area of 30 square meters.

### Sub Letting

AirBnB or similar sub-letting schemes are not acceptable.

### Tenure

We will accept freehold and leasehold properties.

* Ground rent is to be no more than 0.5% of the property value.
* Ground rent escalation interval cannot be any less than 10 years.
* Ground rent escalation must be no more than RPI.

Lease extensions and freehold purchases are acceptable if they are simultaneous to completion. Any new lease must meet our leasehold requirements.

* Any property containing Mundic concrete.
* Any property where commercial usage exceeds 20%. The commercial element should not extend to light engineering, livestock, rearing or caring for domestic animals. Such use should not include circumstances where clients are seen on the premises on a regular basis (e.g., dental surgery would not be acceptable).
* Live/work units.
* Any property deemed unsuitable security by the valuer which the Underwriter agrees is unsuitable.

## Existing Customers

### Porting (moving home)

Perenna recognises that existing customers may wish to move home and transfer their mortgage to a different property. Customers can apply to port to a new property after they've had their mortgage with us for 12 months. Our standard lending policy applies to all porting applications.

If the customers wish to take additional borrowing when they move home, their existing balance will remain on their existing product rate however any additional borrowing will need to be taken out at an interest rate available at the time.

### Additional Borrowing

Existing customers who wish to release equity can apply for additional borrowing once they've had their original mortgage with us for at least 12 months.

Our standard lending policy applies to all additional borrowing applications.

### Consent to Let

We understand that customers experience changes to their circumstances and that sometimes they may need to consider measures such as temporarily letting their home. We will consider any requests from customers who want to let out their property, the following policy will apply:

* The customer must provide evidence of monthly rental income. We will require a letter from a reputable letting agent who is either a member of the Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA), Member of the Property Ombudsman Scheme or Member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS).
* We will not allow CTL in first 12 months except for armed forces personnel.
* No additional borrowing, porting, or rate switching will be allowed while within CTL.
* The interest rate will be increased by 1% for the full duration of the CTL period.
* There is no maximum period for the CTL arrangement and the interest rate increase can only be removed once Perenna has been notified the property is no longer being let.
* The rental coverage ratio must be 125% at the customers product rate plus an extra 1%. This is calculated at the current repayment method.
