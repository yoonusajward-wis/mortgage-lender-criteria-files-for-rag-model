### Conflict of interest

Intermediaries are required to act appropriately where an application represents a potential conflict of interest situation. This applies to both new business and product transfer applications. You can't deal with an application in your own name. This includes acting as the accountant for your self-employed applications where you're a qualified accountant.
For firms where there is no independent person to process the application and validate all necessary documentation, the application will need to be put through another firm.

### Client contact information

All new mortgage applications submitted must provide a personal email address and mobile number for each client.
If your client is unable or unwilling to give this information through the intermediary application process and they still wish to apply for a Santander mortgage, they'll need to contact Santander directly by phone.

For applications where their income is used to meet the £25,000 minimum income criteria, your client must have the permanent right to reside in the UK e.g. indefinite leave to enter (ILE) or remain in the UK (ILR) or settled or pre-settled status (EEA/Swiss citizens). This must be supported by 1 of the following:

Further information may be available from www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/settle-in-the-uk

 Guarantors

We don't accept guarantor applications.

 Identification

A Confirmation of Verification of Identity Certificate must be completed and meet the requirements set out within the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group Guidance for UK Financial Sector.

 Portfolio landlords

We define portfolio landlords as a client owning 4 or more mortgaged let properties (including holiday lets) on completion of the new Buy to Let property with us, whether it's on their own, with anyone else or in a limited company or LLP where your client owns an interest.
We don't accept portfolio landlords unless your client is remortgaging without capital raising (£4£). Please see the 'Eligibility criteria' section.

 Porting

It's possible to 'port' most existing products to a new mortgage providing it's for a house purchase but not to a property being remortgaged or owned mortgage-free.
Your client's entitlement to port their mortgage product is always subject to the conditions for transferring the loan to a new mortgage in their mortgage terms and conditions. In particular, any new mortgage application made will be subject to a full credit assessment. Your client and property must meet our lending criteria at the time of the new application.
If we don't agree a new mortgage, your client won't be able to port their mortgage product and they may then be required to pay the ERC if they subsequently redeem their existing mortgage.
Where redemption of the existing BTL mortgage and purchase of the new BTL property isn't simultaneous, providing the purchase of the new BTL property completes within 3 months of the redemption date, the existing product can be ported to the new BTL mortgage.
On redemption of the existing mortgage the ERC is paid in full and a refund will be made on completion of the new BTL purchase, as long as the product is ported for the full amount. If the new BTL mortgage is less than the existing mortgage, the ERC refund will be a proportionate amount.
Any additional borrowing must come from the new business BTL product range.

 Property Investment Club

We don't accept applications where the property is being purchased by, from or connected to a Property Investment Club.

 Residency

All clients must:

be resident in the UK (excludes Isle of Man)
have the right to remain in the UK permanently.

Exceptions to this policy are applicants temporarily overseas (e.g. BFPO, offshore worker) who'll be returning to live in their UK owner-occupied residential property.

 Self-employed

We'll not accept applications from clients who've been self-employed or owned their business for less than 1 year.
Your clients must provide at least 1 year of trading figures.

 Solicitor panel

All BTL mortgage applications are required to use a solicitor from the Santander panel. We don't accept BTL applications on a dual representation basis. You can use the solicitor panel search to find a solicitor on our panel.

## Fees

### Early repayment charges (ERC)

If an ERC applies to a loan part, your clients can make capital repayments of up to 10% of the balance on this loan part each calendar year without incurring a charge. A minimum amount may apply. If the product fee has been added to the loan, your client can repay this up to 21 days following completion. Repayment of the product fee won't affect your client's 10% ERC free allowance.
The mortgage must remain with us until the product charge end date or any applicable ERC will be charged. In addition, if a benefit package is taken with the product, there's a benefit package end date which may differ from the product charge end date. If the benefit package end date is before the product charge end date, an ERC will still be applicable until the product charge end date.
Should your client redeem their mortgage before the benefit package end date, they'll need to repay the benefit (£250 cashback or £200 for remortgage legal work). The benefit package end date is shown on the mortgage illustration and the rate bulletin. The repayment of the benefit package ERC will be in addition to any product ERC which may apply.
Your client won't pay any applicable ERC if on or before the charge end date, they:

simultaneously with redemption take a mortgage on a new property that completes with us for the same amount and product terms as the previous mortgage. Please see the 'Porting' section for more information; or
simultaneously with redemption, if their existing deal has 9 months or less to expiry at application, choose to take a new product with us for a least the same amount.

A product ERC is a percentage of your client's outstanding mortgage balance at the time of redemption. The level of charge differs by product term. The ERC percentage remains the same until the product charge end date.

### Fees

All mortgage fees are the same as residential rates set out in the Santander tariff of mortgage charges

Please note we don't currently offer additional loans if your client has a Buy to Let or consent to let mortgage.

 General Buy to Let conditions

Our Buy to Let mortgages don't allow a landlord to borrow additional funds from Santander after completion of the mortgage.
We reserve the right to ask for additional client information where we deem necessary.

 Interest only applications

Pure interest only is available subject to the sale of the Buy to Let property. No minimum buffer applies.
Interest only investment/endowment is permitted subject to criteria.

 Mortgage buffer

There is a £750 buffer available on all purchase and remortgage offers excluding undervalue transactions.
Please note the mortgage buffer can exceed the product LTV, but it can't go over 90% LTV. Where this facility is required, please make sure your client informs their solicitor.

 Mortgage loan

Minimum loan £25,000.
Maximum loan £750,000 per property.
No higher lending charge applies.

 Mortgage term

Minimum 5 years.
Maximum 40 years.

 Remortgaging

For all Buy to Let remortgages the property must have been owned for at least 6 months.
We don't accept applications where your client is remortgaging their existing residential property as a Buy to Let, regardless of any future intentions.
We don't normally accept applications that include a change of borrower at the same time.
We'll consider remortgaging with capital raising for personal use up to 75% LTV, including:

home/property improvements
personal debt consolidation
investment, including purchase of another Buy to Let or residential property.

Capital raising for business purposes isn't accepted.

### Repayment methods

We offer repayment, pure interest only subject to the sale of the Buy to Let property, and investment linked interest only where the vehicle meets the residential lending criteria for the vehicle and its value.

## Property

### Cladding

For most flats, the valuer won’t ask for any information before they complete the valuation report. So, you don’t need to send us anything upfront. If the valuer finds there is cladding that raises a concern and we don’t already hold building records, they’ll let you know what they need to give a valuation.
If the valuer asks for further information, you should provide this in the exact format they’ve asked for. It should be on headed paper from the building owner or management company.
**England, Wales and Northern Ireland**  
Although we'll consider other supporting documents, we still need a letter from the building owner or management company if the valuer asks for this.

**Scotland**  
We may be able to accept an EWS1 for the individual flat concerned if it's sent with a letter of provenance.

### Leasehold properties

We don't accept applications on leaseholds where the leaseholder has or will have a controlling interest in the freehold.
The minimum time remaining on the lease at the expiry of the mortgage term must be:

30 years for mortgages on capital and interest
50 years where any part of the loan is on interest only.

Applications are subject to a satisfactory valuation.
Please note that the property will be valued by a third party registered RICS valuer. When a property is leasehold, its value will depend upon the length of time remaining on the lease. Typically value reduces as the lease term expires. Consequently, there may be occasions where the valuation of a leasehold property could be insufficient to support the mortgage required, even though the time remaining on the lease meets the above lending requirements.

### Loan to value restrictions

* New build flats maximum LTV 75%.

We don't accept applications for Right to Buy properties still within the discount repayment period.

* no more than £100,000 below the current market value.

The loan to value is based on the reduced purchase price.

## Valuations

We'll arrange for a valuation of the property to be let. The valuer will advise the expected rental income and the value of the property.
We'll accept properties that our valuer considers:

suitable for marketing as an owner-occupation property without alteration
acceptable for mortgage purposes by mainstream lenders.
capable of being let/re-let within a maximum of 3 months.
capable of selling within 6 months.
suitable security where there are multiple tenants.

Where the location of the property means demand is limited to the investor market, the property is only acceptable if demand is considered to be sustainable and based upon tangible characteristics of the locality and economy e.g. a university.
The opinion of the valuer will be final and non negotiable.
