SECTION 10: INCOME & AFFORDABILITY
URL: https://www.bucksbs.co.uk/intermediaries/criteria/buy-to-let/income-affordability/
Criteria Items: 11
================================================================================

# Income & Affordability

## Rental Income Coverage

Buy-to-let applications are primarily assessed based on rental income coverage rather than personal income affordability. The rental income must be sufficient to cover the mortgage payments at the required stress rate.

## Minimum Income Requirements

For standard buy-to-let applications, there is typically no minimum personal income requirement as the assessment is based on rental income. However, personal income may be considered as part of the overall assessment to ensure applicants can meet their personal commitments.

## Income Assessment

Personal income may be assessed to ensure applicants can afford their personal commitments and that the lending decision is sustainable. This helps ensure applicants can cover mortgage payments if the tenant stops paying or the property needs maintenance or repairs.

## Rental Cover Calculation

The Society uses rental cover ratios and stress rates to assess lending amounts. The rental income must exceed the mortgage payment at the stressed rate to provide a buffer for the situations mentioned above.

## Tax Considerations

The Society will take into account the additional cost of increased tax liability for landlords where applicable, particularly in relation to finance costs and rental income taxation.

## Affordability for Different Applicant Types

- Standard Buy to Let: Assessment based primarily on rental income coverage
- Consumer Buy to Let: Assessment based on affordability rather than standard BTL rental calculations (see JBSP section)
- ExPats: See ExPats section for specific ExPat income and affordability criteria
- Portfolio Landlords: See Portfolio Landlords section for specific criteria

## Income Evidence

All income sources must be evidenced appropriately. For details on acceptable income types and evidence requirements, please refer to the Employment section and Interest Only section.
