### The Mortgage Works Portfolio Landlord Definition

A portfolio landlord is a borrower with:

- Four or more distinct mortgaged Buy to Let UK rental properties, OR
- Seven or more mortgaged Buy to Let properties for remortgage applications without capital raising.

This includes:

- Properties owned through a Limited Company.
- Consent to Let properties.
- All Buy to Let mortgages owned solely or jointly by the applicant(s).

### Additional Information

- Foreign properties are not considered when assessing portfolio landlords.
- Where there are two applicants, the combined number of rental properties is used.

- Example: If Applicant 1 owns three mortgaged properties and Applicant 2 owns five, they collectively own eight and are treated as portfolio landlords.

---

### Affordability Assessment

All new mortgage applications are assessed to ensure the client can cover the monthly mortgage interest payment.

The existing portfolio is also assessed to ensure the overall aggregate:

- Loan to Value (LTV)
- Interest Cover Ratio (ICR)

is sustainable.

The assessment is based on the entire portfolio, including:

- The new property.
- Any rental properties without a mortgage.

Different products apply depending on portfolio size. Check the latest product guide before application.

---

### Existing Portfolio Rental Calculation

### Up to 10 Mortgaged Buy to Let Properties at Completion

- Maximum LTV: 75%
- Stress rate: 4.75%
- Interest Cover Ratio (ICR): 145%

### 11 or More Mortgaged Buy to Let Properties at Completion

- Refer to latest product guide for:

- Maximum LTV
- Stress rate
- ICR

---

### Portfolio Checker

Use the Portfolio Checker tool to get an indication of whether the client’s portfolio is likely to fit criteria.

---

### Keying Applications in TMW Online

- At DIP stage, gross annual Buy to Let income and total number of properties are reviewed to determine portfolio landlord status at completion.
- If the client has four or more mortgaged properties:

# Property criteria

### Minimum Property Standards
We want to help landlords provide quality homes to their tenants. That's why we only lend on properties that meet certain minimum standards.

The property must be in a reasonable condition, have the appropriate licence where required, and any alterations must have the relevant approvals. It should also be in a suitable location with sufficient rental demand.

We won't accept properties where their proximity to commercial or adverse uses could result in noise, smells, or other disturbances likely to impact demand and marketability.

[Check our Minimum Property Standards page](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/minimum-property-standards) on whether a property would meet these standards.

### Property Concentration Exposure Limits
The Mortgage Works will consider its overall exposure by applicant, geographical area and development when assessing applications. These exposure limits are per applicant and the number of units include securities mortgaged to other lenders and/or unencumbered properties. The maximum concentration that can be considered per development is:

- **1-3 Units:** 1 unit if a purchase application. For remortgages we can consider up to 3 flats in a block of no more than 3 flats, providing the applicant has owned each of their flats for at least 12 months; or up to 3 houses in a road of no more than 3 houses if the applicant has owned each of their properties for at least 12 months.
- **4-20 Units:** 25%, rounded down to the nearest unit.
- **21+ Units:** Maximum of 10 in a postcode up to the first digit of the second grouping (e.g. BH2 6). Up to 5 in the exact postcode (e.g. BH2 6EP).

### Minimum Property Value/Purchase Price
£65,000 (apart from HMO where the minimum property value is £100,000).

### Under Market Value Transactions
Properties must be purchased at full market value:
- Please let us know if there are any incentives.
- Properties being purchased for more than 10% below the market value will not be considered.
- This doesn't include properties purchased from a recognised developer and the discount/incentive can be evidenced.

### Scheme Abuse
The Mortgage Works customers aren't allowed to live in the Buy to Let property at any time and will be in breach of the terms and conditions of the mortgage contract should they choose to do so. Where this is the case, The Mortgage Works's policy is to give the customer a period of time in which to vacate the property, or instead remortgage to a residential loan. If a customer fails to comply with these terms, this may lead to legal action being taken against them, which could ultimately result in The Mortgage Works taking possession of the property.

### Valuation Criteria
- Leasehold properties must have a minimum lease of 70 years at application.
- The valuer must be satisfied that there is a market for any property taking the lease term into consideration.
- Although an application may meet the guidelines above, the property may still be declined by the valuer, e.g. a mortgage application in England for a 20 year term with a 71 year unexpired lease is within policy, but the valuer may advise the property is not readily marketable and saleable and we will therefore not consider the property as suitable security.

### Construction Types

**Traditional Construction**

The following are regarded as traditional construction and normal lending terms apply:

**Walls:**
- Cavity outer walls of brick/reconstituted stone/block (including rendered walls) with inner walls of brick or block.
- Timber framed property with outer walls of brick/reconstituted stone/block (including rendered walls), built 1970 or after.
- Solid stone (eg limestone, granite).
- Cob - or any regional variant (for example cobb, clom and Wychert).

**Roof:**
- Tile (concrete)
- Slate
- Thatch (reed or straw)
- Felt, asphalt
- Copper, lead

**Spray Foam Insulation:**

If spray foam insulation has been fitted in the wall voids of the property, then the valuer will decline the property.

Where spray foam has been installed in the rafters, frame, and/or underfloor structure, the property will initially be declined by the valuer, but can be reconsidered with evidence of either:

Confirmation the installation of the foam is in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, **and**
- The full pre-survey suitability report including details of the materials/isolating card
- The condensation risk assessment
- Evidence of BBA certification
- The warranty/guarantee provided of the installation and insulation. This warranty must be transferable upon sale of the property to the new owners.

**Or**

A Chartered Building Survey (FRICS or MRICS qualified) should be instructed to undertake an invasive inspection. They'll need to report on the frame integrity. Where it requires remediation or foam removal work, you will need to include an estimated cost.

**Non Traditional Construction:**

Many properties have been built using a variety of other construction methods. Lending terms vary depending on construction types and if a repair scheme, where appropriate, has been used. Where a property is of non traditional construction please contact your usual Service Centre with the following details for further advice:
- The name of the type of construction
- Year built (if known)
- Flat/terrace/semi or detached
- Details of any repair scheme if appropriate and if the scheme applies to the whole block (e.g. the whole terrace/both semi's)

The exact construction name is important as lending terms may differ between different types and year built. For example, our lending terms differ between Gregory, Gregory Drury System 3 and Gregory Housing. All three have different lending terms and it is important to ensure you give us the full and accurate name to avoid us giving inappropriate advice.

**Modern Methods of Construction:**

We're supportive of development schemes which incorporate Modern Methods of Construction (MMC), although an MMC scheme must display sufficient robustness, technical rigour and suitability for its location. Due to the wide and constantly changing range of products in the market, each development (not system) is treated independently. Please provide the information below to enable us to consider your development fully:
- **Principal construction materials** - e.g. steel frame, timber frame, CLT (Cross Laminated Timber)
- **Details of the roof and wall finishes** - please also provide confirmation/evidence of their British Board of Agrément (BBA) or similar accreditation, which should be for a minimum 30 year lifespan (to include fixings)
- **Warranty details** - this should be a mainstream warranty accepted by The Mortgage Works (preferably "NHBC Accepts"). We also require confirmation as to whether the system has Buildoffsite Property Assurance Scheme (BOPAS) accreditation
- **Any available site specific information regarding the development**.
### Purpose Built Flats, Converted Flats and Studio Flats
The internal floor area must be no less than 30 square metres. Studio Flats must contain a separate bathroom.

Where the property is a Studio Flat, enter '1' for number of bedrooms.

**Freehold Flats:**

In general we do not accept freehold flats or maisonettes, or where each flat in a block has its own separate freehold title. However, we will accept flats without a lease as suitable freehold security if:
- There are no more than four flats in the block (if there are five or more this will be treated as a commercial proposition and not accepted)
- The remaining flats are all subject to a minimum lease of 70 years

Coach house flats are acceptable as a freehold where there is one flat above garages or an access way.

Flats in blocks over four storeys high should have a lift. This applies when the subject flat is on the lower floors. We may allow exceptions, but this is subject to how marketable the asset is and the advice we receive from valuers. Five storeys means a ground floor with four floors above (excluding basements).

### Property Developers

- Applications where the loan purpose is to fund the development and sale of property are not acceptable.
- Where the client is a Property Developer, an underwriting assessment will be carried out to ensure:

- There is no risk of structural alteration or subdivision to the proposed security.
- Capital raised will not be used to fund a development project.
- Applications meeting remortgage policy for properties built or converted by an applicant can be accepted, provided:

- The property is fully complete.
- The property will be let on completion.

---

### Local Authority Flats

- Former local authority flats in blocks of more than five storeys are not accepted.
- This also applies to:

- Maisonettes in blocks of more than five storeys.
- Scottish tenements in blocks of more than five storeys.
- Properties that were, or still are, in local authority ownership.

---

### Lease Terms

- Minimum acceptable lease term: 70 years.

- If the lease term is less than 70 years:

- You must confirm at application that the lease will be extended on or before completion.
- An automatic “Decline” decision will be produced.
- A Decline Appeal form must be completed and submitted with a solicitor’s letter confirming either:

  - The applicant(s) owns or is intending to purchase the Freehold Title, OR
  - The lease is being extended, with confirmation of:

    - Length of lease (years)
    - Date of commencement
    - Ground rent (£ amount)
    - Ground rent review frequency
    - Ground rent increase methodology (e.g. RPI linked)

- Lease extensions are only allowed on new and existing lending when completed under the Leasehold Reform Act.

- The valuer must confirm there is a market for the property taking lease terms into consideration.

- Different limits apply for New Build lease terms.

- The valuer may reflect marketability concerns in their valuation, including:

- Ground rent escalation linked to property value or an index greater than RPI.
- Onerous lease clauses (e.g. disproportionate service charges, event clauses).

### Lease Terms That Will Always Result in Decline

- Ground rent ≥ 0.5% of the property value.
- Ground rent review period ≤ 5 years.
- Ground rent doubling in less than 20 years (e.g. every 5, 10 or 15 years).
- Ground rent escalating by compounded RPI.

These examples are not exhaustive. Solicitors must refer any lease terms that may affect value or saleability.

---

### Estate Charges

- Estate Rent Charges or Estate Management Charges may apply to freehold or leasehold properties.
- Charges must be reasonable.
- If charges exceed £500 per annum:

- Details must be provided so the valuer can assess impact on valuation.

---

### Japanese Knotweed

Properties with Japanese Knotweed are considered with caution.

### If Japanese Knotweed:

- Is causing visible material damage, OR
- Is likely to prevent use of or access to amenity space, OR
- Is visible on adjoining land and unmanaged with potential to significantly impact the property,

Then:

- A specialist eradication report is required.
- A 5-year insurance-backed warranty against reappearance is required.
- Repairs to property/services may be required before suitability is confirmed.

### If Japanese Knotweed:

- Is not causing visible material damage and not restricting amenity space, OR
- Is visible on adjoining land but is managed with no significant impact risk,

Then:

- Written confirmation is required from the applicant confirming awareness of the presence and risks.
- Independent professional advice is recommended.

---

### Building Insurance

- Adequate insurance must be in place.
- A policy schedule may be required showing:

- The Mortgage Works (UK) plc noted as mortgagee.
- Switching mortgage products does not affect house insurance.

---

### Post Valuation Queries Reports

Valuers may request specialist reports to:

- Highlight defects.

### Process

- The valuer specifies required reports.
- A qualified professional must complete the report.
- Reports must be uploaded to the case.

- Non-cladding related fire safety concerns with external wall systems and any attachment (e.g. balconies).
- Any other significant fire safety concerns in a multi-storey, multi-occupancy building.

---

### Why Do We Ask for More Information Before Mortgage Offer?

It’s important that fire safety issues are identified and addressed with your client as early as possible.

If we’re able to issue a mortgage offer, this ensures your client can be confident that fire safety issues won’t arise later in the mortgage journey, for example close to completion.

---

### What Happens Next?

Each jurisdiction (England, Wales and Scotland) has introduced different legislation and requirements to address fire safety concerns.

We’ll need additional information to determine whether the property is suitable security. Our requirements depend on:

- The location (jurisdiction) of the property (England, Wales or Scotland).
- The height of the building.
- Whether the fire safety issues are being remediated and/or mitigated.
- Whether the issues are being refuted by the Principal Accountable Person (responsible for repairing and reporting on common parts).

---

### Our Requirements for Cases Affected by Fire Safety Issues

If a valuer declines a property due to fire safety concerns, we’ll contact you. We’ll know the jurisdiction and building height.

You must confirm whether the property’s fire safety issues are being remediated and/or mitigated (e.g. under the Developer Pledge).

Once the remediation/mitigation route has been identified, submit the required documentation outlined below.

If a **free legal fee product** is selected and the valuer raises fire safety concerns, we cannot proceed on a free legal fee basis. A new product using panel solicitors must be selected.

# Houses in Multiple Occupation criteria

The status of a property as an HMO will be determined by the valuer.

### Definition
We consider the following types of property as a HMO:
- A property occupied by five or more people
- A property with five to seven lettable rooms in an area commensurate with multi letting

Properties subject to selective licence are only classified as a HMO where at least one of the above conditions are met.

A property occupied by 4 people or fewer, even if licensed and sharing the characteristics of a HMO, is not eligible for HMO lending. The rental assessment will be based on a single family figure and a non HMO product should be selected.

### Valuation
- All HMO applications, must have a valid EPC with a rating of 'E' or better. We don't accept exemptions for HMOs.
- All HMO applications, including Further Advances, we'll require a Specialist Security valuation, which is payable by the client. See our [valuation page](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/valuation#specialist-security-valuation) for fees.
- For Further Advance and Remortgage applications, before carrying out a valuation, we'll require a copy of the HMO licence. This needs to be attached to the case where the case Requirement has been generated. **If this isn't received within 15 working days, we'll cancel the application**.
- You'll need to update us with details of a selective licence. You can do this by emailing us with 'selective license HMO' as the subject.

### Criteria
- Minimum property value is £100,000
- **Maximum LTV and loan amounts for Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO):** 65% LTV up to £750,000; 75% LTV up to £500,000.
- See our table for [maximum loan amount per property](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/general#maxiLoanProperty) for full details.
- 175% Interest Cover Ratio (ICR) applies to all HMO applications, regardless of tax status.
- For remortgage applications, or borrowers considered a portfolio landlord, there is no need to validate Buy to Let or HMO experience
- For purchase applications where the applicant is not a portfolio landlord, we may need to validate BTL/HMO experience. We define acceptable experiences as:
  - 2 years’ ownership and letting experience of a BTL property, or,
  - 1 year’s ownership and letting experience of an HMO property.
- We won't accept Let to Buy applications
- For valuation purposes, we'll assess rental cover on a multi-tenanted basis
- All let properties will be subject to an:
  - Assured Shorthold Tenancy agreement 
  - Short Assured Tenancy agreement
  - Private Residential Tenancy Agreement in Scotland (there is no maximum tenancy)
  - Occupation Contract in Wales (must be a minimum of 6 months, maximum of 36 months).
- Single and multiple tenancy agreements accepted
- A property must have no more than four habitable storeys and no more than one kitchen
- Properties consisting of more than one self-contained unit under a single title are not acceptable
- The property must offer a communal living room. We can consider a large open plan kitchen/living room if it is big enough to meet reasonable occupant needs as a communal room.
Please see our [general criteria](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/general) for full details.
### Mandatory HMO licensing
Under the [Housing Act 2004 (opens in a new window)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/contents), your client must have a licence for all large HMOs in England and Wales. A large HMO is 3 or more storeys and occupied by 5 or more persons forming at least 2 separate households.
### HMO criteria
We'll lend on properties that need a HMO licence if they meet the following criteria:
- **Remortgage and further advance:** A relevant current licence must be in place. There may be some cases where proof that a licence has been applied for are acceptable.
- **Remortgage converting a residential property to a buy to let:** Proof that the relevant licence has been applied for.
- **Purchase:** Proof that the relevant licence has been applied for.
- All HMO applications must comply with the most current property standards, such as minimum sizes for sleeping rooms. This is the case even where the landlord has a current licence received before the standard changed, as they'll need to meet the standard to renew it.
If a landlord has a licence that is not suitable for their use of the property, we'll decline. We'll require proof that the correct licence has been applied for or obtained.
### HMO valuations
We'll instruct our valuers to ensure that the property conforms to any prevailing legislation. For example, if any rooms let for sleeping do not meet the current minimum sizes, we'll exclude these from the lettable room count and the Gross Rental Valuation.
### Small HMO
Sometimes [selective or additional licensing](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/general#licensing) applies to a small HMO (also known as a C4). We don't treat these applications as HMOs unless they meet our definition of HMO above.
### Article 4 direction
Local authorities use article 4 direction to control the quality of housing in a given area. It limits specific kinds of development, such as converting a property from residential to an HMO.
We'll lend on properties subject to Article 4 direction. We don't treat these applications as HMOs unless they meet our definition of HMO above.
If the property is within an Article 4 direction, we need proof of either:
- Confirmation of Article 4 consent
- Certificate of Lawful Use

We need this before the valuation, and for all application types.

### Valuation Policy

Where a physical valuation is required, safety is the priority. Valuers will complete a detailed safety assessment with the customer before conducting the valuation. If the customer is not comfortable allowing entry, the application will be placed on hold until the customer is ready to proceed.

Valuers may complete an **“external only”** assessment. A safety assessment still applies and the valuer will explain the process to the customer. If additional information is required, the valuer may request photos from the applicant/vendor, with support provided via telephone/email.

Valuation reports are valid for **3 months**. A mortgage offer must be issued before the valuation report expires.

A **re-inspection fee is £100**. The Mortgage Works may conduct an additional inspection (for example to confirm completion of a New Build originally valued off plans).

Pre-valuation suitability checks can be raised using the **Pre-valuation enquiry form**:
[https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/db62-pre-valuation-property-enquiry-form.pdf?rev=3366c7ebd53449669f85b09e9ac96887&hash=134017700718E845AA38192A78EF40AD](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/db62-pre-valuation-property-enquiry-form.pdf?rev=3366c7ebd53449669f85b09e9ac96887&hash=134017700718E845AA38192A78EF40AD)

Valuation will be carried out once the relevant fee has been received.

For HMO guidance see:
[https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/hmo#valuation](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/hmo#valuation)

---

### Valuation Appeals

To appeal the valuation figure, the appeal must meet the following requirements (appeals missing these will be rejected):

- At least **two comparable properties**, similar type/style/size/location, **sold/rented within the last 6 months**.
- A **summary and/or additional comparables** explaining the reason for appeal, based on the evidence provided.
- For **New Build** properties: **three** comparable sales required:

- one from the **same site**
- one from a **similar local New Build site**
- one **Non New Build** property in the local area

**Important information**
Valuations can only be appealed within **10 working days** of you or your client being made aware of the valuation outcome. A response will be provided within **10 working days** and this is the final outcome (cannot be appealed again).

Once all evidence is ready, contact broker support to request the **Valuations Appeal form**, then submit it to: **[valuation.appeals@nationwide.co.uk](mailto:valuation.appeals@nationwide.co.uk)**

---

### Transcribed Valuations (Scotland)

Transcriptions are **not accepted** for valuation purposes on **Scottish Buy to Let** applications. A Mortgage Valuation Report will be instructed on all cases and a valuation fee will be payable by the customer.

---

### Energy Efficiency Regulations (EPC)

### General

The EPC shows energy performance and potential improvements. When submitting an application, ensure the **correct property address** is entered, as the EPC (or exemption) will be verified on the register.

Exemption guidance:
[https://www.gov.uk/guidance/domestic-private-rented-property-minimum-energy-efficiency-standard-landlord-guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/domestic-private-rented-property-minimum-energy-efficiency-standard-landlord-guidance)

---

### Properties in England and Wales

EPC register:
[https://www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate](https://www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate)

### Applications at 75% LTV or below

A **valid EPC must be submitted** with all applications unless there is a valid exemption. The EPC must be rated **E or higher**. Until this is received, a valuation cannot be instructed and the application cannot progress (this applies to existing tenants and new tenancies).

### Applications above 75% LTV

The property must have an EPC rated **C or above**. Applications that do not meet this requirement will be **declined**, including appeals. If declined, a new application must be submitted at **75% LTV or below** with a new product selected.

### Remortgage with capital raising (including Porting)

For remortgage with capital raising (e.g. to purchase/refurbish another property), the expectation is the client carries out works required to bring the security asset to:

- minimum **E** rating (for applications at 75% LTV or below), or
- minimum **C** rating (for applications over 75% LTV)

### New Build

No EPC evidence is required at application stage, as it is not available until completion.

### Further advance

All further advances require a **valid EPC before submission**. A Valuer cannot recommend suitability without a valid EPC. The property will be reconsidered once a valid EPC is provided.

### When EPC is outside policy (England & Wales)

Applications may be considered outside policy subject to purpose rules:

- **At 75% LTV or below:** if EPC is **F or G**, only a **further advance** will be accepted where the **sole purpose** is funding improvements to reach **E or above**.
- **Over 75% LTV:** if EPC is **D, E, F or G**, only a **Green Further Advance** will be accepted where the **sole purpose** is funding improvements to reach **C or above**.

The valuer will assess EPC data and detail required works in the valuation report. Costs of works will be reflected in the valuation figure.

### Green Further Advance applications

A mortgage offer condition will require the client to undertake work within **3 months**. A reinspection may occur 3 months after completion to confirm works or review an updated EPC showing improvements.

### Retentions and cost thresholds (Further advance)

If the further advance is for any other product (per current retention policy), the application can proceed if the cost of work is no more than:

- **£2,500** (current value up to **£100,000**), or
- **£5,000** (current value over **£100,000**)

If costs exceed these thresholds, a **full retention** applies. Maximum loan and LTV are calculated on the **purchase price** or **pre-works value** (whichever is lower).

### Portfolio applications

The EPC assessment described applies only to the property on the new application. EPC ratings on properties held with other lenders are not assessed.

### Post completion lending criteria

Landlords must comply with new regulations for post completion contract variations (including transfer of equity, conversions, or term amendments).

---

### Properties in Scotland

(For purchase, remortgage, further advance, and porting)

Scottish EPC register:
[https://www.scottishepcregister.org.uk/](https://www.scottishepcregister.org.uk/)

Properties with EPC **F or G** are still lendable. The valuer will assess EPC data and detail works needed to bring the property to a minimum **E** rating in the valuation report. Costs of works will be reflected in the valuation figure, and a mortgage offer condition will require completion of the work within **3 months**, unless proof of a valid exemption or an updated EPC is provided prior to completion.

A reinspection may take place 3 months after completion to confirm works.

Retention treatment follows the current retention policy thresholds (as above): the application can proceed where the cost of work is no more than the applicable threshold; if it exceeds the threshold, a full retention applies. Maximum loan and LTV are calculated on the **purchase price** or **pre-works value** (whichever is lower).

---

### Other Information

The valuer is instructed by The Mortgage Works to determine suitability of the security.

For BTL applications, the lower of **passing rent** or **estimated rental value** (as given by the valuer) will be used.

For standard BTL applications, estimated rental value is based on market rent for **single family occupancy**. HMO cases should follow HMO criteria:
[https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/hmo](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/hmo)

If the valuation has been carried out and the property is unsuitable security, or the application does not proceed, the valuation fee will not be refunded.

---

- Where a further advance and change of borrower (also known as a transfer of equity) have been requested at the same time, either transaction must have completed before applying for the other. **Please note** that both a change of borrower (transfer of equity) request and further advance application will be assessed based on the relevant criteria at the time of submission.
- Regulated Buy to Let applications
- Where the requested further advance term exceeds the longest term on any existing mortgage accounts linked to the property. If the term exceeds this, we'll reduce it to the closest whole year to the main loan.
- If the existing mortgage term has less than 5 years remaining. The existing term will need to be extended to 5 years or more prior to submission of the further advance application.

### Affordability assessment
To ensure your client can cover the additional monthly mortgage interest payment, we'll stress the existing loan based on the term and the overall LTV.

See more information on our rental checks.

**Stress Rates:**
For further advances, we'll continue to stress individual loan elements separately. However, the stress rate applied to existing lending will be set to a minimum of the stress rate applicable to the new borrowing.

Please download our [further advance calculator](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/t1203-further-advance-calculator.xlsx?rev=2e74460f628942ea9bee0a66148745db&hash=E45A7C29CED39B6A01D5F81DCCF8818F) for support calculating potential further borrowing.

### How to apply
Applications for further advances are submitted to Full Mortgage Application through [TMW Online (opens in a new window)](https://www.tmwonline.co.uk).

**Key points:**
- There's no DIP produced, as the decision is made once the application is received and assessed (including a new valuation and a credit search).
- Further advance applications are valid for **six months** from the date of the first offer.
- After submitting a further advance, you'll need to wait **six months** after the payment has been made on the original loan before submitting another.
- You can only submit a maximum of **two further advances in a year**, and **four further advances in a three-year period**.
- If you wish to provide your client with a Mortgage Illustration, you can request one using our Manual Mortgage Illustration request form.
- For more information on the fees your client may have to pay, view our [Tariff of Charges](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/t21-tariff-of-charges.pdf?rev=4c77f29564554eeca6392b0c335a3b41&hash=0093D6D6F9463680DED387373BAAA24C).

### Rate switches and further advances
If your client is looking to complete a rate switch and a further advance, these are two separate applications and you'll need to decide which to do first.

**Important considerations:**
- If you complete a rate switch application first, we're unable to guarantee that a further advance application will be accepted subsequently.
- Completing a further advance first may mean that any subsequent rate switch could be charged at a higher rate due to the increased LTV. The further advance will need to have completed prior to a rate switch application.
- If your clients have started a further advance application but don't want to continue with this as they would rather proceed with a Rate Switch, we'll require instructions from your clients to cancel the application. This can be included with the paper application form for the product switch.

### Drawdown of funds
You can email a copy of the completed Further Advance Release form to **tmw-completions@themortgageworks.co.uk**.

**To avoid delays in your completion, please ensure the subject field of the email includes:**
- The case reference number
- And that it states one of: COT, Certificate of title, Report on title, or Release of funds form

**Funds release timing:**
- We'll require **five working days notice** when submitting a further advance release.
- We'll release the funds on: the same day as completion if you select a working day; the next working day if you select Sunday or a Bank Holiday; or the Friday before if you select a Saturday.

**Important requirements:**
- All applicants on the offer must sign a 'Further Advance release request'.
- The bank details on the release form should match the Direct Debit details held on the main loan.
- An offer is valid for **6 Months**, so completion should be within this time. We may be able to offer a short extension if needed.
- We'll need to check there are no arrears on the main loan before we can release the funds.
- You'll need to ensure you have fulfilled any special conditions before requesting any further advance funds.
- Where a solicitor is acting in the transaction, we can release the advance to the solicitor.

### Funds release
If you or the solicitor emails us requesting funds release, please ensure the subject line includes: our **8 digit reference number** and the words **'Funds release form'**.

Failure to include this information may delay completion.

### EPC Requirements
All further advance applications require a valid EPC before submission. The Valuer will be unable to recommend the property as a suitable security without a valid EPC. We'll reconsider the property once you provide a valid EPC.

We'll consider applications where a property's EPC rating is outside of our policy, subject to the following:
- **For applications at 75% LTV or below:** if the EPC rating is F or G, we'll only accept a further advance where the sole purpose of the additional borrowing is to fund improvements to make the property compliant with EPC minimum standards of E rated or above.
- **For applications over 75% LTV:** if the EPC rating is D, E, F or G, we'll only accept a Green Further Advance application where the sole purpose is to fund improvements to make the property compliant with our policy of C rated or above.

### HMO Applications
All HMO applications, including Further Advances, require a Specialist Security valuation, which is payable by the client. For Further Advance and Remortgage applications, before carrying out a valuation, we'll require a copy of the HMO licence.

Further advance applications for HMO require payment of the full specialist security valuation fee.

### Limited Company
Further advances on Limited Company mortgages are accepted.

### Foreign Nationals
Exceptions to the 65% LTV limitation will be considered for Further Advance applications where there is work required to maintain the property.

### Fire Safety
For further advances, we'll consider applications if the funds are being raised to carry out the required remedial works.

See [Green Further Advance](#green-further-advance-mortgage) section for Green Further Advance product details.

# Green Further Advance mortgage

Maximum loan on Green Further Advance products is £15,000.

**For applications over 75% LTV:** if the EPC rating is D, E, F or G, we'll only accept a Green Further Advance application where the sole purpose is to fund improvements to make the property compliant with our policy of C rated or above.

**Green Further Advance applications:**
We'll place a condition on the mortgage offer confirming your client must undertake the work within 3 months. We can reinspect the property 3 months after completion to: ensure your client has carried out the work or requested an updated EPC to show they have made the improvements.

The valuer will assess the EPC data and detail any works needed to bring the property to the minimum standards above in the valuation report. We'll reflect the costs of any works in the valuation figure.

---

# Income criteria (A–Z summary)

### Interest Cover Ratio (ICR)
To reflect the different taxable income levels of applicants, we have a range of ICRs that are applicable depending on the customer and/or application. We'll class all personal applications where the client owns more than three rental properties (with or without a mortgage), as a higher rate taxpayer.

The gross rental income, confirmed by the valuer, must cover the monthly mortgage interest payment by at least:

- **Lower rate tax:** Buy to Let and Let to Buy 125%; HMO and Limited Company HMO 160%; Limited Company Buy to Let 125%.
- **Higher rate tax:** Buy to Let and Let to Buy 175%; HMO and Limited Company HMO 175%; Limited Company Buy to Let 125%.

**125% ICR** applies to all Limited Company applications (except Houses in Multiple Occupation) and those in personal names where the following criteria is met:
- Applicants declare themselves to be Lower rate taxpayers and declare their gross annual income is less than £50,271 per applicant upon completion of the mortgage (less than £43,662 gross income in Scotland).
- Personal applicants can have **no more than 3 rental properties** (with or without a mortgage). This includes any The Mortgage Works applications in progress.

Of the existing buy to let income input at Decision in principle stage, we'll take into account the following in our assessment of an applicant's overall income:
- 75% of all rental income. This includes existing and proposed buy to lets with The Mortgage Works.
- 100% of all other sources of income.

### Additional ICR information
In order to ensure the correct ICR is applied to the application, you need to key 100% of all existing BTL income.

For purchase and Let to Buy applications we'll add 75% of the new property's proposed gross rental income to the applicants' annual income.

For joint applications, we'll add half of the 75% proposed gross rental income to each applicants' annual income.

We'll treat any applicant that has recently left employment, retired or started self-employment as a higher rate taxpayer.

View our [Portfolio landlord criteria page](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/portfolio-landlords) to see the rental calculations and maximum LTVs for portfolio landlords.

### Stress rates
When calculating affordability, we apply a range of stress rates depending on application type, loan purpose, term and loan to value.

### Buy to Let, Let to Buy, Large Portfolio and HMO applications
We'll always use whichever is the higher of stress rate or pay rate (pay rate +2.00% where applicable).

- **Like for like remortgage***: All fixed – 65% LTV or lower: 4.00% or pay rate; higher than 65% LTV: 4.50% or pay rate.
- **Purchase, Remortgage with capital raising or Further advance:** 1 and 2 year fixed, all LTVs: 5.50% or pay rate +2.00%; 5 year fixed, 65% LTV or lower: 4.00% or pay rate.

*For 2 year fixed Let to Buy and Large Portfolio Let to Buy products on a like for like remortgage, we'll use 5.50% or pay rate +2.00%.

### Limited Company Buy to Let and Limited Company HMO applications
- Like for like remortgage: All fixed, all LTVs: 4.50% or pay rate.
- Purchase, Further advance: 1 and 2 year fixed, all LTVs: 5.50% or pay rate +2.00%; 5 year fixed, all LTVs: 4.50% or pay rate.

### Tracker and variables
Tracker and variable products have a stress rate of 5.50% or pay rate +2.00%. We'll always use whichever is the higher.

### Further advances
We'll continue to stress individual loan elements separately in line with the above. However, the stress rate applied to existing lending will be set to a minimum of the stress rate applicable to the new borrowing.

Please download our [further advance calculator](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/t1203-further-advance-calculator.xlsx?rev=2e74460f628942ea9bee0a66148745db&hash=E45A7C29CED39B6A01D5F81DCCF8818F) for support calculating potential further borrowing.

### Pay rates
Check our [product finder](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/products/product-finder) to find out what the pay rate is for your product.

### Minimum income
There is no minimum personal income requirement. Proof of personal income may be requested to support an application. We'll use this with other information relating to the landlord and the property. This is to validate that the loan is going to be used for its intended purpose.

**Non-portfolio applications:**
We'll carry out further underwriting. We may require additional proofs to support sustainability by requesting **one or more of the following** evidence:
- 3 months' bank statements
- Personal savings to support 6 months' rental income
- Additional household income*
- Available household funds to act as a sinking fund*

- We'll only consider household income/sinking fund where the third party is a spouse/partner of the applicant. They'll need to hold a joint residential mortgage with them.

We may decline the application if we consider the exposure to be too high. For example, where they have a large residential mortgage solely owned. Or a large amount of unsecured debt not consistent with the household income.

See [Income Proofs](#income-proofs) section for detailed information on acceptable income types and proof requirements.

# Let to Buy criteria

If your client is a first time or experienced landlord looking to remortgage their existing main residence as a Buy to Let property and purchase a new residential property, we can help. You'll find our full range of options in the 'Let to Buy' section of our [product finder](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/products/product-finder).

**Tip:** Applications where the new residential property will be purchased with cash are considered provided the current main residence is unencumbered and the onward purchase is not a private sale.

### Key criteria

**How much will we loan?**
- The maximum LTV we'll consider for Let to Buy mortgages is 80%. See our table for [maximum loan amount per property](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/general#maxiLoanProperty).

**What you should know:**
- **The same solicitor must act on behalf of your client for both purchase and remortgage transactions.**
- Applicants must've owned and lived in their residential property for at least six months (with or without a mortgage) at the time they apply.
- We'll only accept applications where there's a simultaneous onward purchase of a new residential property (with another lender), address to be supplied on application and confirmed by the acting solicitor prior to completion.
- Applicants must leave the address on which the loan is secured upon completion – and provide us with a new correspondence address.
- If the new residential property is bought using a mortgage, a copy of the onward residential mortgage offer must be provided prior to completion.
- The onward property must be immediately habitable – and this must be confirmed either by the property's sales literature or a physical valuation/Home Survey Level 2 Report (which replaced the Homebuyer Report).
- The names on both the onward purchase and The Mortgage Works mortgage should match. Any variance in ownership can be considered prior to application.
- Joint applications, or applications where the onward purchase is in joint names, can only be submitted if the applicants are partners.
- The applicant's main residence must not be listed for sale on the open market or sold subject to contract.
- To submit cases simultaneously for The Mortgage Works and Nationwide for Intermediaries applications, please read our [Let to Buy processing guide](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/db54-let-to-buy-process-guide.pdf?rev=9c9d0d3b71434bb79ba9a028d048ec6b&hash=66CE6241EBCB627A92F0B490346D4768).
- Where the applicant is using the lower 125% ICR, proof of personal income is required, but in all other cases we don't normally need this. **Please note:** if we do need to see proof of personal income for another reason then we'll ask you to send this to us.
- Applications where the new residential property will be purchased with cash are considered, provided: the current main residence is unencumbered and the onward purchase is not a private sale.

# Valuation Criteria (A–Z summary)

- Leasehold properties must have a minimum lease of 70 years at application.
- The valuer must be satisfied that there is a market for any property taking the lease term into consideration.
- Although an application may meet the guidelines above, the property may still be declined by the valuer, e.g. a mortgage application in England for a 20 year term with a 71 year unexpired lease is within policy, but the valuer may advise the property is not readily marketable and saleable and we will therefore not consider the property as suitable security.

For detailed valuation information including fees, policy, and appeals, please see the [Valuation](#valuation), [Valuation Fees](#valuation-fees), [Valuation Policy](#valuation-policy), and [Valuation Appeals](#valuation-appeals) sections.
