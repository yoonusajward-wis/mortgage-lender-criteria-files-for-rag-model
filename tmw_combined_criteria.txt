 LIMITED COMPANY CRITERIA
 OVERVIEW:
If you're helping clients secure and manage buy to let mortgages through a limited company, we're here to support you. Our criteria provides clear guidance on eligibility, company structure, and the application process.

**Can I sell my BTL property to my SPV?** Applications in a limited company name purchasing from one of the directors and/or shareholders aren't considered private sales. So selling your BTL from your name to your SPV is not assessed under private sales criteria; it is assessed under our normal rules for this type of transaction. We'll accept a gift of equity if the property is already owned by the director(s) and is being purchased by their Limited Company; these applications must be submitted as a purchase. See [Gifts](#gifts) and [Private sales](#private-sales) for full details.

**Can I sell my residential property (main residence) to my SPV?** Yes, we'll consider applications where the SPV is purchasing a main residence from one of its directors/shareholders to use as a buy to let, subject to: simultaneous onward purchase of a new residential property (with another lender), director leaving the property on completion, copy of onward mortgage offer if applicable, and a Limited Company purchase product. See [Purchase of Directors main residence](#purchase-of-directors-main-residence) for full details.

Information: We have a range of Limited Company Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) product options. Make sure to also check our [HMO criteria](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/hmo).

## Limited Company key criteria
### Company information
To qualify for a Limited Company mortgage with us the company has to be set up with the sole purpose of buying, letting and selling properties. These are known as Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs).

  * Only SPVs with one or more of the following Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes are considered: 
    * 68100, 68201, 68209, 68320
    * To find which SIC codes are associated with a company you can [search here (opens in a new window)](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/)
  * Partnerships or LLPs aren’t accepted.
  * Companies must be registered in England, Wales or Scotland. SPVs are considered from day one of being set up.
  * A floating charge over assets of the company isn't required.
  * SPVs that have associated commercial property/assets are not accepted.
  * Personal guarantees are required from all directors in all cases.
  * The account from which the Direct Debit payment is made must match the Limited Company name.
  * We won't accept Layered companies. A layered company is where another company has a shareholding in the proposed company, or where the proposed company has a shareholding in another company.
  * The company must have a private limited legal status
Please be aware that all guarantors will need to obtain Independent Legal Advice prior to completing the [Deed of Guarantee](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/deed-of-guarantee.pdf?rev=be910841a7da469e8ef16cc59614e765&hash=5A437F989F5C6270EDEE9DD6996991CB).

### Company structure
  * Directors/shareholders must meet our [standard lending criteria](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/a-z).
  * Companies must be a SPV; company structures outside of this aren’t acceptable.
  * The total number of employees must not exceed the number of directors/shareholders listed.
  * Applicants  
    * All directors/shareholders with a shareholding of more than 20%, or anyone in the SPV who is a person of significant control (PSC) must be party to the mortgage (the "applicants").  
    * The maximum number of applicants is two.  
    * Applicants must have a combined 75% of the shareholding and voters rights.  
    * All applicants (whether director or shareholder) will need to provide a personal guarantee and obtain independent legal advice.  
    * We'll accept applications where there are two directors, but only one is a shareholder who owns all shares within the company.  
    * We'll accept applications where one applicant is only a shareholder (who owns more than 20% of the shares in the company). The other applicant must be a director and shareholder with at least 1% shareholding.  
    * Directors/shareholders may only have one limited company financed with us.
  * Minority Shareholders  
    * A limited company may also have up to four additional shareholders who can own up to 25% of the company shares between them (the "minority shareholders").  
    * Minority shareholders do not need to be part of the mortgage and won't be credit assessed or required to sign a personal guarantee.  
    * No individual minority shareholder can have more than 20% of the total shares.  
    * The minimum age of a minority shareholder is 21 years old.  
    * Minority shareholders must be related to as least one of the names applicants (see the FCA definition of a 'related person').  
    * Minority shareholders shares cannot be held in a trust or within another company.
  * Directors/shareholders who have an application with us must match records at Companies House. 
    * Make sure to input the Company/Person with Significant Control (PSC) director details correctly, because we will not accept a structure where there is a PSC that is not an applicant. Please note we're legally obliged to tell Companies House if there's a discrepancy between beneficial owner details and the information on the [people with significant control (PSC) register (opens in a new window)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/report-a-discrepancy-about-a-beneficial-owner-on-the-psc-register-by-an-obliged-entity#when-to-make-a-discrepancy-report).
    * The company must advise us of any proposed changes in the directors of the company or shareholding. If your client fails to comply, this may lead to legal action against them.
  * If your clients are both directors of the company however only one has a shareholding, then 100% of the shareholding must be owned by the directors to be acceptable to The Mortgage Works.
  * Only the director of the SPV will have account access with decision making responsibilities. For example completing a rate switch or amending the term or repayment method.
### Can I sell my residential property (main residence) to my SPV?
**Answer:** Yes. We'll consider applications where a Limited Company (SPV) is purchasing a **main residence** from one of its directors/shareholders to use as a buy to let, subject to:
  * A simultaneous onward purchase of a new residential property (with another lender), address to be supplied on application and confirmed by the acting solicitor prior to completion.
  * The director/shareholder leaving the residential address the Limited Company is purchasing upon completion – and providing us with a new correspondence address (if required).

  * A simultaneous onward purchase of a new residential property (with another lender), address to be supplied on application and confirmed by the acting solicitor prior to completion.
  * The director/shareholder leaving the residential address the Limited Company is purchasing upon completion – and providing us with a new correspondence address (if required).
  * Providing a copy of the onward residential mortgage offer prior to completion (if applicable).
  * A Limited Company purchase product must be selected.

### Portfolio landlords
  * If the company and its directors own four or more mortgaged properties, either separately or altogether, then our [Portfolio landlord criteria](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/portfolio-landlords) applies.

## Source of deposit
### Intercompany loans
We'll accept an intercompany loan as a source of deposit, subject to:
  * The company structure mirroring across the SPV and the connected company (directors/shareholders must match). Where an SPV is jointly owned, it is acceptable for the donor company to be owned solely by one of the SPVs shareholders.
  * It must be a UK to UK company (no offshore companies).
  * The donor company must have been trading for a minimum of 12 months and must have accounts filed that reflect the donor company actively trading. It's unacceptable for only dormant accounts to have been filed.
**When applying, the following evidence must be provided:**
  * Loan Agreement 
    * The loan is repayable.
    * A term has been agreed (not exceeding the term of the mortgage).
    * The rate of interest due is at least [HMRC's (opens in a new window)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-beneficial-loan-arrangements-hmrc-official-rates/beneficial-loan-arrangements-hmrc-official-rates) 'Actual Official Rate'.
    * The monthly payment or interest payments are being rolled up.
    * Where there's a monthly loan repayment, we'll deduct this from the rent and the surplus used for affordability purposes in the ICR calculation.
    * Where the interest payments are being rolled up, this will not affect affordability.
    * There is no interest or charge over the security.
  * Donor company bank statements 
    * One month of bank statements, dated within the previous three months. If the loan has been sent to the SPV, we'll require a full month of transaction history prior to the transfer.
  * SPV company bank statements 
    * Three months’ worth of statements from the borrowing SPV if it is an established company.
We won't assess the application until you have submitted all required evidence.

### Can I sell my BTL property to my SPV?
**Answer:** Applications in a limited company name purchasing from one of the directors and/or shareholders **aren't considered private sales**. So if you sell your BTL property from your name to your SPV (where you are a director or shareholder), that transaction is not assessed under the private sales criteria; it is assessed under our normal rules for this type of transaction.

We'll accept a gift of equity if the property is already owned by the director(s) and is being purchased by their Limited Company. **Please note** these applications must be submitted as a purchase. See [Private sales](#private-sales) for full private sales criteria and [Gifts](#gifts) for gift of equity details.

### Gifts
  * A [gifted deposit](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/t725-confirmation-of-gifted-deposit-form.pdf?rev=3fc9b9c4885047f6ad50ac5a5bc26993&hash=2AD9B74B0EB536FB50F8BCDE6BC60D72) from individuals to director(s) are acceptable, however gifts to the company are not.
  * We'll accept a gift of equity if the property is already owned by the director(s) and is being purchased by their Limited Company. **Please note** these applications must be submitted as a purchase.
  * Non-UK gifts and funds from non-UK companies or trusts are not accepted. If directors of the SPV have funds overseas, these can be considered subject to an audit trail.
### Shareholder funds
We'll accept the source of funds coming from someone who is only a shareholder of the SPV where the funds are:
  * a loan to the company
  * from Share Capital Investment (where the shareholder is increasing their shareholding by injecting capital into the business).  
    * If the share capital investment is coming from a shareholder with shares of 20% or less, we will need to know what their new shareholding will be after the transaction completes.  
    * If any share capital investment increases the shareholding of an individual to over 20%, we will classify them as an "applicant" (refer to company structure policy above).  
    * We accept a maximum of two applicants and any share capital investments will need to be within this criteria or an alterative deposit source would be required.  
    * Any changes to shareholding need to be completed before applying.

**We won't accept:**
  * Advance payment for goods or services from the SPV
  * Gift or Capital Contribution (where the shareholder provides funds as a gift or voluntary capital contribution without receiving additional shares).

### Bounce back loans
  * We don't accept Business Bounce Back Loan as deposit.

## Before you apply
You can apply for Limited Company products through [TMW Online (opens in a new window)](https://www.tmwonline.co.uk). For a newly created Limited Company, please wait 3 days before applying for any products.

You can obtain a Decision in Principle (DIP) through TMW Online. You should obtain Mortgage Illustrations from your usual sourcing system.

### Companies House pre-application check
Before you apply, we'll validate SPV information on Companies House to ensure it matches. There can be examples where you get a decline message related to Unacceptable Person of Significant Control.

This could be due to:
  * A difference between Director or Shareholder details and Person of Significant Control (PSC) on Companies House.
  * A PSC that is not an applicant.
  * The Officer and PSC name match on Companies House but the Shareholder names are not correct.

To correct this, please do the following:
  * Check the filing history and any confirmation statements to see if the Shareholder details have been updated. If they have, they will show the names of the current Shareholders for you to compare to.
  * If the Shareholder names do not show, check the document labelled 'Incorporation' and this will detail the Shareholder structure when the Limited Company was created. Open this document and go to the Initial Shareholdings section and check that the Shareholder names and addresses match.
  * If the names do not match, the shareholding information on Companies House will need to be updated.
  * It takes 3 days for Companies House updates to show on our records, so please wait to reapply.
  * If all names match and there are no differences, please email dip@themortgageworks.co.uk who will review and add a decline appeal to your case to enable you to continue.

If our interest rates change before the update of the Companies House information, we may be able to honour the original rate you were looking to apply for. This is only if there's a discrepancy in the spelling or special characters of the Directors, Shareholders or Company name.

Once Companies House has been updated, you should submit a new application on one of the updated rates. This must be within **7 working days of the original application**. Then email dip@themortgageworks.co.uk quoting both the **new and the original reference number**. You'll need to include details of the original product you were looking to apply for.

TMW Online updates every 10 minutes, so you can get an up-to-date [case update](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/placing-business/case-tracking) online.

## Underwriting requirements
Our specialist underwriting team will confirm the case requirements when your client's application is submitted. In most cases, we'll request:
  * Proof of deposit (purchase applications)
  * [Property schedule](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/property-schedule.xlsx?rev=dc63865d1f0a44928ae077994ad5ac1c&hash=A8E3326A1F1B542E6FC9714121CB600F) (where a property schedule is required, the application will not be reviewed by an underwriter until it is received)
  * 3 months' personal bank statements for all directors.

If you haven't met with the directors 'face to face' then you'll be required to certify documents used to support your client's application.

If we're unable to verify your client electronically, we'll ask you to provide the Certificate of Incorporation.

We reserve the right to request additional information to satisfy requirements.

## Company changes
**If your client is planning to make changes to the directors or shareholding of their company, they must let us know directly in advance.**

If the company changes have already been made, your client will need to re-instate the structure we originally agreed to, or redeem their mortgage.

You must apply for our consent to make any company changes. All applications are subject to a risk assessment.

Please complete and ask your client to sign our [Change of Director/Shareholder form](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw-direct/documents/p3770-ltd-co-change-of-director.pdf?rev=877e236eff5544d6bec54bcfd03cd910&hash=F422E7DA3D4F61F2723C6BDC26E24DAD). You can then post the completed form, along with the required identification to:
**The Mortgage Works**  
Northampton Administration Centre  
Kings Park Road  
Moulton Park  
Northampton, NN3 6NW 

If we approve your request, you will need to pay a 'change of parties fee'. See [Our fees and charges](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/t21-tariff-of-charges.pdf?rev=4c77f29564554eeca6392b0c335a3b41&hash=0093D6D6F9463680DED387373BAAA24C) for details.

### Unacceptable company changes
We won't accept the following changes:
  * Conversion of the company to a Charity, Trust or Foundation.
  * Restructuring the company so it becomes part of a layered company, including subsidiaries, parent and sister companies.
  * Having any links to offshore companies, including the Channel Islands and Isle of Man.
  * Addition of directors or shareholders under the age of 21.

## Additional information
  * For new applications, we'll be paying an additional 0.10% gross procuration fee for Limited Company cases. This will be payable via your usual Mortgage Club or Network.
  * We aren't insisting on separate solicitor representation for you and your client.
  * We'll require first legal charge over the security.

## PORTFOLIO LANDLORD CRITERIA
 MAIN URL: https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/portfolio-landlords
 SOURCE: The Mortgage Works (Nationwide Building Society)
 TYPE: Detailed Lending Criteria

### Portfolio Landlord Criteria
#### The Mortgage Works Portfolio Landlord Definition
A portfolio landlord is a borrower with **four or more** distinct mortgaged Buy to Let UK rental properties. Or seven or more for remortgage applications without capital raising.

This includes:
- Properties owned through a limited company
- Consent to let properties
- All BTL mortgages owned solely or jointly by the applicant(s)

**Additional Information:**
- We won't consider foreign properties when assessing portfolio landlords.
- If there are two applicants, we'll use the combined number of rental properties for both. For example, if the first applicant solely owns three mortgaged properties and the second applicant solely owns five properties, they would collectively own eight properties in the portfolio.
### Affordability assessment
All new mortgage applications with The Mortgage Works are assessed to ensure your client can cover their monthly mortgage interest payment.
We'll also assess the existing portfolio to ensure the overall aggregate LTV and ICR is sustainable. The assessment will be based on the entire portfolio, including the new property and any rental properties without a mortgage.
We have different products depending on the size of your client's portfolio, so please make sure to check our [latest product guide](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/t59-btl-product-guide.pdf?rev=a5d53bf80be14cb1a050a4627d5b3e25&hash=FEFA1068E7EC08CE535FB60D498E88C9) prior to application. 
The following rental calculations and maximum LTVs will apply across your client's portfolio:
####  Existing portfolio rental calculation 
| Portfolio Size | Maximum LTV | Stress Rate | Interest Cover Ratio (ICR) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Up to 10 mortgaged BTL properties at completion | 75% | 4.75% | 145% |
| 11 or more mortgaged BTL properties at completion | | | |

**Portfolio Checker:**
Use our [portfolio checker](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/t1502-portfolio-checker.xlsx?rev=dad2f6a7b4074eda90e0ef0623f2d4da&hash=A0419C11C6CF5D576D3DD847FC62F1F2) to get an indication as to whether your client's portfolio is likely to fit The Mortgage Works criteria.

#### Keying Applications in TMW Online
- We ask for your client's personal income on all cases.
- At DIP stage, we look at gross annual buy to let income as well as the total number of properties, to identify if your client is/will be a portfolio landlord on completion of the application.
- If your client has 4 or more mortgaged properties, we'll ask for details of the total value and outstanding mortgage balances secured against the portfolio.

**Please note:**
- If a BTL property is jointly owned between your clients, you only need to enter them under one applicant, not both.
- If you're creating multiple applications for the same applicant(s), please try to submit them at the same time.
- If a property is owned by an applicant and a 3rd party, please key the full rental as well as the full mortgage amount.
#### Packaging Applications (Including Portfolio Portal)
Portfolio landlords with 11 or more mortgaged BTL properties need to provide three months' current account statements showing rental payments for their portfolio.

All portfolio landlords will need to provide a property schedule, either by:
- Keying the details into our [Portfolio Portal (opens in a new window)](https://broker.nbs.mls.hometrack.com/tmw)

## PROPERTY CRITERIA
 MAIN URL: https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/property-criteria
 SOURCE: The Mortgage Works (Nationwide Building Society)
 TYPE: Detailed Lending Criteria

### Property Criteria

#### Minimum Property Standards
We want to help landlords provide quality homes to their tenants. That's why we only lend on properties that meet certain minimum standards.

The property must be in a reasonable condition, have the appropriate licence where required, and any alterations must have the relevant approvals. It should also be in a suitable location with sufficient rental demand.

We won't accept properties where their proximity to commercial or adverse uses could result in noise, smells, or other disturbances likely to impact demand and marketability.

[Check our Minimum Property Standards page](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/minimum-property-standards) on whether a property would meet these standards.

#### Property Concentration Exposure Limits
The Mortgage Works will consider its overall exposure by applicant, geographical area and development when assessing applications. These exposure limits are per applicant and the number of units include securities mortgaged to other lenders and/or unencumbered properties. The maximum concentration that can be considered per development is:

| Development Size/Road | Maximum Concentration |
|---|---|
| 1-3 Units | 1 Unit if a purchase application. For remortgages we can consider up to 3 flats, in a block of no more than 3 flats, providing the applicant has owned each of their flats for at least 12 months. For remortgages we can consider up to 3 houses in a road of no more than 3 houses, if the applicant has owned each of their properties for at least 12 months. |
| 4-20 Units | 25%, rounded down to the nearest unit |
| 21+ Units | Maximum of 10 in a postcode up to the first digit of the second grouping (e.g. BH2 6). Up to 5 in the exact postcode (e.g. BH2 6EP) |

#### Minimum Property Value/Purchase Price
£65,000 (apart from HMO where the minimum property value is £100,000).

#### Under Market Value Transactions
Properties must be purchased at full market value:
  * Please let us know if there are any incentives.
  * Properties being purchased for more than 10% below the market value will not be considered.
  * This doesn't include properties purchased from a recognised developer and the discount/incentive can be evidenced.

#### Scheme Abuse
The Mortgage Works customers aren't allowed to live in the Buy to Let property at any time and will be in breach of the terms and conditions of the mortgage contract should they choose to do so. Where this is the case, The Mortgage Works's policy is to give the customer a period of time in which to vacate the property, or instead remortgage to a residential loan. If a customer fails to comply with these terms, this may lead to legal action being taken against them, which could ultimately result in The Mortgage Works taking possession of the property.

#### Valuation Criteria
- Leasehold properties must have a minimum lease of 70 years at application.
- The valuer must be satisfied that there is a market for any property taking the lease term into consideration.
- Although an application may meet the guidelines above, the property may still be declined by the valuer, e.g. a mortgage application in England for a 20 year term with a 71 year unexpired lease is within policy, but the valuer may advise the property is not readily marketable and saleable and we will therefore not consider the property as suitable security.
#### Construction Types

**Traditional Construction**

The following are regarded as traditional construction and normal lending terms apply:

**Walls:**
- Cavity outer walls of brick/reconstituted stone/block (including rendered walls) with inner walls of brick or block.
- Timber framed property with outer walls of brick/reconstituted stone/block (including rendered walls), built 1970 or after.
- Solid stone (eg limestone, granite).
- Cob - or any regional variant (for example cobb, clom and Wychert).

**Roof:**
- Tile (concrete)
- Slate
- Thatch (reed or straw)
- Felt, asphalt
- Copper, lead

**Spray Foam Insulation:**

If spray foam insulation has been fitted in the wall voids of the property, then the valuer will decline the property.

Where spray foam has been installed in the rafters, frame, and/or underfloor structure, the property will initially be declined by the valuer, but can be reconsidered with evidence of either:

Confirmation the installation of the foam is in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, **and**
- The full pre-survey suitability report including details of the materials/isolating card
- The condensation risk assessment
- Evidence of BBA certification
- The warranty/guarantee provided of the installation and insulation. This warranty must be transferable upon sale of the property to the new owners.

**Or**

A Chartered Building Survey (FRICS or MRICS qualified) should be instructed to undertake an invasive inspection. They'll need to report on the frame integrity. Where it requires remediation or foam removal work, you will need to include an estimated cost.

**Non Traditional Construction:**

Many properties have been built using a variety of other construction methods. Lending terms vary depending on construction types and if a repair scheme, where appropriate, has been used. Where a property is of non traditional construction please contact your usual Service Centre with the following details for further advice:
- The name of the type of construction
- Year built (if known)
- Flat/terrace/semi or detached
- Details of any repair scheme if appropriate and if the scheme applies to the whole block (e.g. the whole terrace/both semi's)

The exact construction name is important as lending terms may differ between different types and year built. For example, our lending terms differ between Gregory, Gregory Drury System 3 and Gregory Housing. All three have different lending terms and it is important to ensure you give us the full and accurate name to avoid us giving inappropriate advice.

**Modern Methods of Construction:**

We're supportive of development schemes which incorporate Modern Methods of Construction (MMC), although an MMC scheme must display sufficient robustness, technical rigour and suitability for its location. Due to the wide and constantly changing range of products in the market, each development (not system) is treated independently. Please provide the information below to enable us to consider your development fully:
- **Principal construction materials** - e.g. steel frame, timber frame, CLT (Cross Laminated Timber)
- **Details of the roof and wall finishes** - please also provide confirmation/evidence of their British Board of Agrément (BBA) or similar accreditation, which should be for a minimum 30 year lifespan (to include fixings)
- **Warranty details** - this should be a mainstream warranty accepted by The Mortgage Works (preferably "NHBC Accepts"). We also require confirmation as to whether the system has Buildoffsite Property Assurance Scheme (BOPAS) accreditation
- **Any available site specific information regarding the development**.
#### Purpose Built Flats, Converted Flats and Studio Flats
The internal floor area must be no less than 30 square metres. Studio Flats must contain a separate bathroom.

Where the property is a Studio Flat, enter '1' for number of bedrooms.

**Freehold Flats:**

In general we do not accept freehold flats or maisonettes, or where each flat in a block has its own separate freehold title. However, we will accept flats without a lease as suitable freehold security if:
- There are no more than four flats in the block (if there are five or more this will be treated as a commercial proposition and not accepted)
- The remaining flats are all subject to a minimum lease of 70 years

Coach house flats are acceptable as a freehold where there is one flat above garages or an access way.

Flats in blocks over four storeys high should have a lift. This applies when the subject flat is on the lower floors. We may allow exceptions, but this is subject to how marketable the asset is and the advice we receive from valuers. Five storeys means a ground floor with four floors above (excluding basements).

#### Property Developers
- Applications where the loan purpose is to fund the development and sale of property are not acceptable.
- Where your client is a Property Developer, we will conduct an underwriting assessment to ensure that there is no risk of structural alteration or subdivision to the proposed security or that capital raised could be used to fund a development project.
- Applications that meet our [remortgage policy](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/general#loanPurpose) for properties that have been built or converted by an applicant can be accepted, providing the property is fully complete and will be let on completion.

#### Local Authority Flats
We won't accept former local authority flats in blocks of more than five storeys. This also applies to maisonettes and Scottish tenements in blocks of more than five storeys that were, or still are, in local authority ownership.

#### Lease Terms
- The acceptable minimum lease term is 70 years. If the lease term is less than this, you must confirm at application that the lease will be extended on or before completion. In this scenario, a 'Decline' decision will automatically be produced – we'll then send you a Decline Appeal form which must be completed and submitted together with a letter from the solicitor confirming the following:
  - Confirmation the applicant(s) owns, or is intending to purchase the Freehold Title, **OR**
  - If the applicant (or the seller as part of a purchase) is extending the remaining lease term, please provide a letter from the solicitor on letter headed paper confirming:
    - Length of lease (years)
    - Date of commencement of lease
    - Ground rent (£ amount)
    - Ground rent review frequency
    - Ground rent increase methodology (e.g. RPI linked)

We'll only allow lease extensions on new and existing lending when completed under the Leasehold Reform Act.

The valuer must be satisfied there is a market for any property, taking the lease terms into consideration.

- **Please note** that there are different limits for acceptable New Build lease terms – see [New Build property lease](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/new-build-hub#property-criteria) terms above for details
- Where the valuer believes marketability will be impacted by the lease terms, they may reflect this in their valuation, e.g.
  - Where ground rent escalation is linked to the value of the property or an index greater than The Retail Price Index (RPI)
  - Where lease clauses appear onerous, e.g. disproportionate service charges or event clauses for normal use, such as installing an aerial
- Some lease terms will impact marketability so severely they will always result in the property being declined, e.g
  - Where ground rent is greater than or equal to 0.5% of the property value, or where the review period is less than or equal to 5 years.
  - Where ground rent doubles in less than 20 years (e.g every 5, 10 or 15 years) or escalates by compounded RPI

These examples aren't exhaustive, and the solicitor is expected to refer back to us any lease terms they feel may affect the value or future saleability of the security.

#### Estate Charges
- Estate Rent Charges, or Estate Management Charges, can apply to freehold or leasehold properties.
- Charges must be reasonable at all times. Where charges are greater than £500 per annum, we'll need to be advised what the charges cover so the valuer can assess whether the valuation is affected.

#### Japanese Knotweed
Properties with Japanese Knotweed growing within the vicinity are considered with caution and subject to the following terms:

**If Japanese Knotweed:**
- Is actually causing visible material damage to a structure, **OR**
- Is not actually causing visible material damage but is still likely to prevent use of or access to amenity space, **OR**
- Is visible on adjoining land, but is evidently unmanaged and has the potential to significantly impact the subject property/grounds

Then the applicant will be required to obtain a specialist report in respect of eradicating the plant, including an insurance backed 5 year warranty against re-appearance of the plant, and if necessary, repairs to the property and services will be required for the valuer to make a full assessment of the property's suitability.

**However, if Japanese Knotweed:**
- Isn't actually causing visible material damage to a structure and isn't likely to prevent use of or restrict access to amenity space, **OR**
- Is visible on adjoining land but is managed with no potential to significantly impact the subject property/grounds.

Written confirmation is required from the applicant confirming that they're aware of the presence of this invasive plant and the adverse affects it could have on the property should it spread closer. It is recommended the applicant seeks their own independent professional advice regarding the risk this plant might impose.

#### Building Insurance
The Mortgage Works is legally obliged to ensure that adequate insurance is obtained by your client for the property to be mortgaged. Full details may be required in the form of a policy schedule with the interest of The Mortgage Works (UK) plc noted as mortgagee. Switching mortgage products won't affect your client's house insurance.

#### Post Valuation Queries Reports
Valuers may request specialist reports within their valuation which are:
- Designed to highlight defects
- And/or to assist them in obtaining additional information upon which to base their valuation.

The valuer will advise which reports they need. A surveyor will then need to complete all the requested reports. Once completed, you'll need to upload them to the case, so we can refer them back to the valuer for their consideration. We'll only accept reports from qualified firms and professions and they must show a proper detailed inspection has been made. The initial report might certify that the property is not a suitable security. If this happens we may consider it following an independent review by a specialist.

The following are examples of specialist reports that we might request:

| Report | Criteria |
|---|---|
| **Structural Engineers Report** | Valuers may require this specialist report to consider if a property is suitable security and if there's any required works which could impact the value. For a structural report to be acceptable it must:<br>- Be dated within the last 90 days<br>- Be for the whole property and have comment(s) on any specific issues which the valuer has identified<br>- Be addressed to the applicant and in both names if this is a joint mortgage application. If the report is addressed to a third party (for example the person selling the property), the author of the report must confirm in writing that the applicant, lender (Nationwide) and professional advisers can rely on its contents.<br><br>The report must be on appropriate letter headed paper. It must indicate that the Structural Engineer holds one of the below qualifications:<br>- **Standard** - MICE / FICE / AMI Struct E / MI Struct E / FI Struct E<br>- **Chartered Building Surveyor** - MRICS / FRICS<br>- **Corporate Building/Corporate Structural Engineer** - MASI / FASI / MCABE / FCABE / MCIOB / FCIOB / MIEI (Members of Engineers Ireland). |
| **Damp and timber report** | Valuers may require this specialist report to consider if a property is suitable security and if there's any required works which could impact the value. The report must be:<br>- Dated within the last 90 days<br>- For the whole property<br><br>If remedial damp treatment works are required to the property, your client must have cover with a 10-year insurance backed guarantee. Any guarantee issued must be in the name of the applicants, and/or transferable to new owners. |
| **Electrical report** | We may require an electrical report if the wiring is old or the property has been extended significantly at some point in the past. An inspection will involve the testing of all electrical wiring by a qualified electrician:<br>- **England & Wales** - NICEIC, STORMA or NAPIT registered electricians<br>- **Scotland** - NICEIC registered electricians |
| **Loft conversions** | The valuer might decline the property if they have concerns with the basement conversion, attic conversion or loft room.<br><br>To consider the property as suitable security, you need to provide one of the following:<br>- An original Building Regulations completion certificate.<br>- A Regularisation Certificate.<br>- A Chartered Building Surveyor's report with specific comment on the structural integrity of the conversion. And means of escape and provision of adequate pre-warning (alarm) system. This report should include any required work which you'll need to carry out to improve the safety of the conversion, along with an estimated cost. |

#### Fire Safety Assessment
The valuer will decline the property if it has:
  * cladding with external wall systems and any attachment (e.g. balconies)
  * non-cladding related fire safety concerns with external wall systems and any attachment (e.g. balconies)
  * or any other significant fire safety concerns in a multi-storey, multi-occupancy buildings. 
#### Why do we ask for more information before mortgage offer? 
It’s important that you highlight and address with your client any fire safety issues with the property as soon as possible. 
This means if we’re able to give them a mortgage offer, they can be more confident these issues won’t arise later in their mortgage journey. For example when they’re close to completion.
#### What happens next? 
Governments of each jurisdiction have introduced different legislation and requirements to address fire safety concerns. 
We’ll need some more information to decide if the property is suitable. Our requirements will depend on: 
  * the location (jurisdiction) of the property, (i.e. England, Wales or Scotland)
  * the height of the building 
  * whether the property’s fire safety issues are going to be remediated and/or mitigated. Or, for example, whether they're being refuted by the Principal Accountable Person (the person responsible for repairing and reporting on common parts of the building). 
#### Our requirements for cases affected by fire safety issues 
We'll contact you if a Valuer has declined a property due to fire safety concerns that need to be investigated. We’ll know the jurisdiction and height of the building. However, you’ll need to know whether the property’s fire safety issues are going to be remediated and/or mitigated. For example, whether the building is being remediated under the Developer Pledge. 
So we can review the property further, once you have identified the relevant remediation/mitigation route for the building, please use the guidance below, so you know what information to send us.
If a free legal fee product is selected and the valuer raises concerns about fire safety on a property, we can't proceed on a free legal fee basis. We'll contact you to let you know. A new product must be selected using solicitors from our panel.

[ Scotland - 11 metres or more (or 5 storeys or more) This will reveal additional content ](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/property-criteria#!scotland) 
The Government has introduced consultation with the Housing (Cladding Remediation) (Scotland) Bill. They have also suggested amendments to the Building (Scotland) Act [2003]. This will pave the way in how impacted properties will be assessed and remediated in Scotland. These have not yet made their way into formal legislation.
**Our requirements when dealing with Scottish applications**
The valuer will decline the property pending receipt of an [EWS1 form (PDF, 200KB - opens in a new window)](https://www.rics.org/content/dam/ricsglobal/documents/to-be-sorted/ews1-form-version-3_interactive.pdf). Where a valuer has cladding or non-cladding fire safety concerns with external wall systems, attachments (e.g. Balconies), or any other significant fire safety concerns.
The form must be: 
  * obtained from the property owner. The ‘Client organisation’ on the form must be the building owner. We won't accept it in the name of the applicant/client. 
  * fully completed
  * accompanied by a letter of provenance on headed paper, from the signing firm which details
    * their area of business
    * qualifications
    * confirmation that they've completed the form.
It's the duty of the building owner to ensure the signing firm is a member of an appropriate professional body. See the [RICS website (opens in a new window)](https://www.rics.org/uk/) for more information.
The specialist will complete the form and select either ‘low risk’ or ‘high risk’ and will then choose a rating of either:
  * **A1, A2 and B1** - we’ll send the form to the valuer for assessment. If accepted, they’ll provide an amended valuation report.
  * **A3 or B2** - we’ll assess the case and let you know our decision. We may request confirmation from the building owner about the remedial building work required. And who’ll be liable for the cost of those works. For Scotland, we'll require confirmation from the building factors/managing agents acting for the co-proprietors.
**For all application types where the building owner will cover the remedial costs, we’ll require confirmation in writing from the building owner that:**
  * you will compile the EWS1 requirements and render the building fire safe (i.e. fall within the definition of A1, A2 or B1) on completion of the remedial works.
  * the interim fire safety measures are satisfactory.
  * you will not pass on costs or hidden charges to the leaseholder (e.g. via service charges).
  * remediation will take place within a reasonable timescale (12 months).
**Where remedial costs fall to individual leaseholders/flat owners**
For remortgage and purchase, if the building owner’s solicitors confirm in writing, we’ll consider applications where the owner has paid for and planned/started remedial works. We’ll decline any applications if remedial works have not yet been paid for or planned/started.
For further advances, we’ll consider applications if the funds are being raised to carry out the required remedial works. We'll require further information from the building owner to make an assessment, including:
  * the compiled EWS1 requirements rendering the building fire safe (i.e. fall within the definition of A1, A2 or B1) on completion of the remedial works.
  * confirmation the interim fire safety measures are satisfactory.
  * a summary of the remedial works required and when the works will take place.
  * costs the leaseholder/flat owner is liable for and when the required funds are due to be paid to the freeholder.

[ New Build assessment This will reveal additional content ](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/property-criteria#!new-build-fire-safety) 
The Building Regulations 2018 banned the use of flammable materials on new high-rise homes. Any buildings started after 21 February 2019 should not contain flammable material.
We require an [EWS1 form (PDF, 200KB - opens in a new window)](https://www.rics.org/content/dam/ricsglobal/documents/to-be-sorted/ews1-form-version-3_interactive.pdf) for any New Build designed/constructed under the old regulations. This is regardless of storey height. For example, where there are concerns around wall systems and attachments.
We won’t require an EWS1 form for New Builds that have been/are being constructed in compliance with The Building Regulations 2018. Unless upon inspection, the valuer has concerns regarding other elements of fire safety.
We'll speak to the Developer/Sales Agent. If the valuer can’t confirm that the latest Building Regulations apply, we'll decline the mortgage valuation report. This is pending confirmation from the Building Owner/Developer/Conveyancer whether it’s compliant with The Building Regulations 2018.

## HOUSES IN MULTIPLE OCCUPATION CRITERIA
 MAIN URL: https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/hmo
 SOURCE: The Mortgage Works (Nationwide Building Society)
 TYPE: Detailed Lending Criteria

### Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) Criteria

The status of a property as an HMO will be determined by the valuer.

#### Definition
We consider the following types of property as a HMO:
- A property occupied by five or more people
- A property with five to seven lettable rooms in an area commensurate with multi letting

Properties subject to selective licence are only classified as a HMO where at least one of the above conditions are met.

A property occupied by 4 people or fewer, even if licensed and sharing the characteristics of a HMO, is not eligible for HMO lending. The rental assessment will be based on a single family figure and a non HMO product should be selected.

#### Valuation
- All HMO applications, must have a valid EPC with a rating of 'E' or better. We don't accept exemptions for HMOs.
- All HMO applications, including Further Advances, we'll require a Specialist Security valuation, which is payable by the client. See our [valuation page](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/valuation#specialist-security-valuation) for fees.
- For Further Advance and Remortgage applications, before carrying out a valuation, we'll require a copy of the HMO licence. This needs to be attached to the case where the case Requirement has been generated. **If this isn't received within 15 working days, we'll cancel the application**.
- You'll need to update us with details of a selective licence. You can do this by emailing us with 'selective license HMO' as the subject.

#### Criteria
  * Minimum property value is £100,000
  * **Maximum LTV and loan amounts for Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO):**

| Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) | Maximum LTV / Maximum loan |
|---|---|
| 65% LTV | Up to £750,000 |
| 75% LTV | Up to £500,000 |

  * See our table for [maximum loan amount per property](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/general#maxiLoanProperty) for full details.
  * 175% Interest Cover Ratio (ICR) applies to all HMO applications, regardless of tax status.
  * For remortgage applications, or borrowers considered a portfolio landlord, there is no need to validate Buy to Let or HMO experience
  * For purchase applications where the applicant is not a portfolio landlord, we may need to validate BTL/HMO experience. We define acceptable experiences as:
    * 2 years’ ownership and letting experience of a BTL property, or,
    * 1 year’s ownership and letting experience of an HMO property.
  * We won't accept Let to Buy applications
  * For valuation purposes, we'll assess rental cover on a multi-tenanted basis
  * All let properties will be subject to an:
    * Assured Shorthold Tenancy agreement 
    * Short Assured Tenancy agreement
    * Private Residential Tenancy Agreement in Scotland (there is no maximum tenancy)
    * Occupation Contract in Wales (must be a minimum of 6 months, maximum of 36 months).
  * Single and multiple tenancy agreements accepted
  * A property must have no more than four habitable storeys and no more than one kitchen
  * Properties consisting of more than one self-contained unit under a single title are not acceptable
  * The property must offer a communal living room. We can consider a large open plan kitchen/living room if it is big enough to meet reasonable occupant needs as a communal room.
Please see our [general criteria](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/general) for full details.
### Mandatory HMO licensing
Under the [Housing Act 2004 (opens in a new window)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/contents), your client must have a licence for all large HMOs in England and Wales. A large HMO is 3 or more storeys and occupied by 5 or more persons forming at least 2 separate households.
#### HMO criteria
We'll lend on properties that need a HMO licence if they meet the following criteria:
  * **Remortgage and further advance:** A relevant current licence must be in place. There may be some cases where proof that a licence has been applied for are acceptable.
  * **Remortgage converting a residential property to a buy to let:** Proof that the relevant licence has been applied for.
  * **Purchase:** Proof that the relevant licence has been applied for. 
  * All HMO applications must comply with the most current property standards, such as minimum sizes for sleeping rooms. This is the case even where the landlord has a current licence received before the standard changed, as they'll need to meet the standard to renew it.
If a landlord has a licence that is not suitable for their use of the property, we'll decline. We'll require proof that the correct licence has been applied for or obtained.
#### HMO valuations
We'll instruct our valuers to ensure that the property conforms to any prevailing legislation. For example, if any rooms let for sleeping do not meet the current minimum sizes, we'll exclude these from the lettable room count and the Gross Rental Valuation.
#### Small HMO
Sometimes [selective or additional licensing](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/general#licensing) applies to a small HMO (also known as a C4). We don't treat these applications as HMOs unless they meet our definition of HMO above.
#### Article 4 direction
Local authorities use article 4 direction to control the quality of housing in a given area. It limits specific kinds of development, such as converting a property from residential to an HMO.
We'll lend on properties subject to Article 4 direction. We don't treat these applications as HMOs unless they meet our definition of HMO above.
If the property is within an Article 4 direction, we need proof of either:
- Confirmation of Article 4 consent
- Certificate of Lawful Use

We need this before the valuation, and for all application types.

### Valuation policy
Where a physical valuation is required, safety is our number one priority. Valuers will need to carry out a detailed safety assessment with the customer before the valuation is conducted. Where a customer isn’t comfortable letting a valuer into their property we’ll place the application on hold and you’ll need to tell us when they’re ready to proceed. 
Valuers may also carry out an ‘external only’ assessment. A safety assessment will still be completed and the valuer will explain the process to the customer. Where more information is needed and photos of the property may help, the valuer will request them from the applicant/vendor. If this is necessary, full support will be provided by telephone/email.
Valuation reports are valid for a period of 3 months. Please be aware that a mortgage offer must be issued prior to the valuation report expiring.
Re-inspection fee is £100. The Mortgage Works reserves the right to conduct an additional inspection of the property. For example, to ensure the completion of a New Build property originally valued off plans.
If you're unsure whether the property would be suitable security for us, you can complete this [Pre-valuation enquiry form](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/db62-pre-valuation-property-enquiry-form.pdf?rev=3366c7ebd53449669f85b09e9ac96887&hash=134017700718E845AA38192A78EF40AD).
The valuation will be carried out when the relevant fee has been received.
Please refer to our [Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) page](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/hmo#valuation) for further guidance.
### Valuation appeals
If you wish to appeal the valuation figure, it’s important that it fits our criteria. We'll need the following information to consider your appeal and will reject appeals which do not provide the following: 
  * Details of at least two comparable properties. They must be of similar type, style, size and location to the subject property and be sold/rented within the last six months.
  * A summary/additional comparables explaining why you're appealing the valuation based on the information and comparable evidence provided. 
  * For New Build properties, three comparable sales are required, one from the same site, one from a similar local New Build site and a Non New Build property in the local area.
**Important information:**
  * Appeals received with missing information, or which don’t meet the necessary requirements will be rejected.
  * Valuations can only be appealed within 10 working days of you or your client being made aware of the valuation outcome.
  * We’ll respond to the appeal within 10 working days. The response will be the final outcome and the valuation can’t be appealed again.
It’s important that you review the above criteria first before contacting us. Once you have all the relevant information to hand you can contact broker support who will send you the Valuations Appeal form, which should be submitted to valuation.appeals@nationwide.co.uk. 
### Transcribed valuations
We don't accept transcriptions for valuation purposes on Scottish Buy to Let Applications. We'll instruct our own Mortgage Valuation Report on all cases as a valuation fee will be payable by the customer.
### Energy Efficiency Regulations
The Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) provides details on the energy performance of a property and what your client can do to improve it.
When submitting an application make sure you input the correct property address, as we'll verify that it has a valid EPC or exemption on the register.
**You can find exemption details at[Domestic Private Rented Landlord Guidance (opens in a new window)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/domestic-private-rented-property-minimum-energy-efficiency-standard-landlord-guidance)**
#### **Properties in England and Wales**
Check your client's property has a valid EPC.
  * [Find an energy certificate (opens in a new window)](https://www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate)
**Applications at 75% LTV or below**
We'll need a valid EPC submitted with all applications, unless there is a valid exemption. The EPC needs to be rated 'E' or higher. This applies to properties where there are existing tenants, as well as properties where a new tenancy is being created. Until we receive this, we can't instruct a valuation or progress the application.
**Applications above 75% LTV**
The property must have an EPC rated 'C' or above. We'll decline applications on properties which don't meet the criteria, including appeals. You will then need to resubmit an application with an LTV of 75% or below and a new product selected.
**Remortgage with capital raising (including Porting)**
As part of any remortgage with capital raising application, for example to purchase or refurbish another property, we'll expect your client to carry out the works required to bring the security asset up to a minimum 'E' rating (minimum 'C' rating for applications over 75% LTV).
**New Build**
You don't need to provide proof of an EPC rating for a New Build application, as it won't be available until after the property is completed.
**Further advance**
All further advance applications require a valid EPC before submission. The Valuer will be unable to recommend the property as a suitable security without a valid EPC. We'll reconsider the property once you provide a valid EPC.
We'll consider applications where a properties EPC rating is outside of our policy, subject to the following: 
  * **For applications at 75% LTV or below:** if the EPC rating is F or G, we'll only accept a further advance where the sole purpose of the additional borrowing is to fund improvements to make the property compliant with EPC minimum standards of E rated or above.
  * **For applications over 75% LTV:** if the EPC rating is D, E, F or G, we'll only accept a Green Further Advance application where the sole purpose is to fund improvements to make the property compliant with our policy of C rated or above.
The valuer will assess the EPC data and detail any works needed to bring the property to the minimum standards above in the valuation report. We'll reflect the costs of any works in the valuation figure.
**Green Further Advance applications**
We'll place a condition on the mortgage offer confirming your client must undertake the work within 3 months. We can reinspect the property 3 months after completion to: 
  * ensure your client has carried out the work or 
  * requested an updated EPC to show they have made the improvements.
If the application is for any other further advance product (as per current retention policy), the application can proceed where the cost of work is no more than:
  * £2,500 (for properties with a current value of up to £100,000)
  * £5,000 (for properties with a current value over £100,000)
A full retention will be applicable if the cost of the work exceeds the values above. We'll calculate the maximum loan and LTV on the purchase price or the figure before the work whichever is lower.
For portfolio applications the valuation policy detailed here will only apply to the property on the new application. We won't assess EPC ratings on other properties held with other lenders.
**Post completion lending criteria**
Landlords must comply with the new regulations for post completion contract variations. This includes transfer of equity, conversions or term amendments. 
#### **Properties in Scotland**
This includes purchase, remortgage, further advance and porting applications.
Check your client's property has a valid EPC 
  * [Scottish Energy Performance Certificate Register (opens in a new window)](https://www.scottishepcregister.org.uk/)
We'll continue to lend on all properties with an EPC rating of F or G. However, the Valuer will assess the EPC data and detail any works needed to bring the property to a minimum E rating in the valuation report.
We'll reflect the costs of any work in the valuation figure, and place a condition on the mortgage offer confirming the work that your client must undertake within 3 months. Unless your client sends us proof of a valid exemption or an updated EPC prior to completion.
To ensure you have carried out the work, we can reinspect the property 3 months after completion.
As per current retention policy, the application can proceed where the cost of work is no more than:
A full retention will be applicable if the cost of the work exceeds the values above.
We calculate the maximum loan and LTV on the purchase price or the figure before the work, whichever is lower.

#### Other Information
- The valuer will be instructed by The Mortgage Works to determine the suitability of the security.
- In the case of BTL applications, we will apply the lower of passing rent or estimated rental value as given by the valuer.
- For all standard BTL applications, the estimated rental value will be based on the market rent for single family occupancy. (See [Houses in Multiple Occupation](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/hmo) for cases submitted as an HMO).
- If the valuation has been carried out and the property has been found to be of unsuitable security or the application does not proceed, the valuation fee will not be refunded.

**Definition:**
We consider the following types of property as a HMO:

  * A property with five to seven lettable rooms in an area commensurate with multi letting

Properties subject to selective licence are only classified as a HMO where at least one of the above conditions are met.

**Key Criteria:**
  * Minimum property value is £100,000
  * **Maximum LTV and loan amounts for Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO):**

| Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) | Maximum LTV / Maximum loan |
|---|---|
| 65% LTV | Up to £750,000 |
| 75% LTV | Up to £500,000 |

  * 175% Interest Cover Ratio (ICR) applies to all HMO applications, regardless of tax status.
  * For remortgage applications, or borrowers considered a portfolio landlord, there is no need to validate Buy to Let or HMO experience
  * For purchase applications where the applicant is not a portfolio landlord, we may need to validate BTL/HMO experience. We define acceptable experiences as:
    * 2 years' ownership and letting experience of a BTL property, or,
    * 1 year's ownership and letting experience of an HMO property.
  * We won't accept Let to Buy applications
  * For valuation purposes, we'll assess rental cover on a multi-tenanted basis
  * All let properties will be subject to an Assured Shorthold Tenancy agreement, Short Assured Tenancy agreement, Private Residential Tenancy Agreement in Scotland, or Occupation Contract in Wales
  * Single and multiple tenancy agreements accepted
  * A property must have no more than four habitable storeys and no more than one kitchen
  * Properties consisting of more than one self-contained unit under a single title are not acceptable
  * The property must offer a communal living room. We can consider a large open plan kitchen/living room if it is big enough to meet reasonable occupant needs as a communal room.

## HMO LICENSING
 MAIN URL: https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/a-z#hmo-licensing
 SOURCE: The Mortgage Works (Nationwide Building Society)

### HMO Licensing
Under the Housing Act 2004, your client must have a licence for all large HMOs in England and Wales. A large HMO is 3 or more storeys and occupied by 5 or more persons forming at least 2 separate households.

**HMO Licensing Criteria:**
We'll lend on properties that need a HMO licence if they meet the following criteria:
  * **Remortgage and further advance:** A relevant current licence must be in place. There may be some cases where proof that a licence has been applied for are acceptable.
  * **Remortgage converting a residential property to a buy to let:** Proof that the relevant licence has been applied for.
  * **Purchase:** Proof that the relevant licence has been applied for.
  * All HMO applications must comply with the most current property standards, such as minimum sizes for sleeping rooms. This is the case even where the landlord has a current licence received before the standard changed, as they'll need to meet the standard to renew it.

If a landlord has a licence that is not suitable for their use of the property, we'll decline. We'll require proof that the correct licence has been applied for or obtained.

See [HMO Criteria](#hmo-criteria) and [Mandatory HMO Licensing](#mandatory-hmo-licensing) sections for more details.

### Interest Cover Ratio (ICR)
To reflect the different taxable income levels of applicants, we have a range of ICRs that are applicable depending on the customer and/or application. We'll class all personal applications where the client owns more than three rental properties (with or without a mortgage), as a higher rate taxpayer.

The gross rental income, confirmed by the valuer, must cover the monthly mortgage interest payment by at least:

**ICR Table:**
Buy to Let and Let to Buy | HMO and Limited Company HMO | Limited Company Buy to Let  
Lower rate tax | Higher rate tax  
125% | 160% | 175% | 125%  

**125% ICR** applies to all Limited Company applications (except Houses in Multiple Occupation). And those in personal names where the following criteria is met:
  * Applicants declare themselves to be Lower rate taxpayers and;
  * Declaring their gross annual income is less than £50,271 per applicant, upon completion of the mortgage. This is less than £43,662 gross income in Scotland.
  * Personal applicants can have **no more than 3 rental properties** (with or without a mortgage). This includes any The Mortgage Works applications in progress.

Of the existing buy to let income input at Decision in principle stage, we'll take into account the following in our assessment of an applicant's overall income:
  * 75% of all rental income. This includes existing and proposed buy to lets with The Mortgage Works.
  * 100% of all other sources of income.

  * is visible on adjoining land, but is evidently unmanaged and has the potential to significantly impact the subject property/grounds

Then the applicant will be required to obtain a specialist report in respect of eradicating the plant, including an insurance backed 5 year warranty against re-appearance of the plant, and if necessary, repairs to the property and services will be required for the valuer to make a full assessment of the property's suitability.

However, if Japanese Knotweed:
  * isn't actually causing visible material damage to a structure and isn't likely to prevent use of or restrict access to amenity space, **OR**
  * is visible on adjoining land but is managed with no potential to significantly impact the subject property/grounds.

Written confirmation is required from the applicant confirming that they're aware of the presence of this invasive plant and the adverse affects it could have on the property should it spread closer. It is recommended the applicant seeks their own independent professional advice regarding the risk this plant might impose.

  * Where ground rent is greater than or equal to 0.5% of the property value, or where the review period is less than or equal to 5 years.
  * Where ground rent doubles in less than 20 years (e.g every 5, 10 or 15 years) or escalates by compounded RPI

### Modern Methods of Construction
We're supportive of development schemes which incorporate Modern Methods of Construction (MMC), although an MMC scheme must display sufficient robustness, technical rigour and suitability for its location.

Please provide the following information to enable us to consider your development fully:
  * **Principal construction materials** - e.g. steel frame, timber frame, CLT (Cross Laminated Timber)
  * **Details of the roof and wall finishes** - please also provide confirmation/evidence of their British Board of Agrément (BBA) or similar accreditation, which should be for a minimum 30 year lifespan (to include fixings)
  * **Warranty details** - this should be a mainstream warranty accepted by The Mortgage Works (preferably "NHBC Accepts"). We also require confirmation as to whether the system has Buildoffsite Property Assurance Scheme (BOPAS) accreditation
  * **Any available site specific information regarding the development**

New applications with existing second charges are not accepted (unless repaid as part of the transaction). Consent to second charges post-completion considered on a strict case by case basis.

This will be subject to criteria and affordability at the time of application, including rental cover assessment and LTV limits (currently the LTV can't exceed 50% LTV before adding second charge) and the purpose must be for home improvements only.

For all standard BTL applications, the estimated rental value will be based on the market rent for single family occupancy. (See Houses in Multiple Occupation for cases submitted as an HMO).

## VALUATION POLICY
 MAIN URL: https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/a-z#valuation-policy
 SOURCE: The Mortgage Works (Nationwide Building Society)

### Valuation Policy
Where a physical valuation is required, safety is our number one priority. Valuers will need to carry out a detailed safety assessment with the customer before the valuation is conducted. Where a customer isn't comfortable letting a valuer into their property we'll place the application on hold and you'll need to tell us when they're ready to proceed.

Valuers may also carry out an 'external only' assessment. A safety assessment will still be completed and the valuer will explain the process to the customer. Where more information is needed and photos of the property may help, the valuer will request them from the applicant/vendor. If this is necessary, full support will be provided by telephone/email.

Valuation reports are valid for a period of 3 months. Please be aware that a mortgage offer must be issued prior to the valuation report expiring.

Re-inspection fee is £100. The Mortgage Works reserves the right to conduct an additional inspection of the property. For example, to ensure the completion of a New Build property originally valued off plans.

If you're unsure whether the property would be suitable security for us, you can complete a Pre-valuation enquiry form.

The valuation will be carried out when the relevant fee has been received.

See [Valuation Criteria](#valuation-criteria) section for full details.

[Read more about Green Further Advances](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/products/green-further-advance-mortgage)

#### Eligibility
To be eligible for a further advance, your client **must**:
  * Be a Buy to Let customer
  * Have owned and let the security property for at least **six months**
  * Have been making full monthly payments on their mortgage for at least **six months**
  * Not have been in arrears during the last 12 months, and no more than two months in arrears
  * Intend to borrow at least **£2,500**
  * Have an EPC rating between **A-C for an LTV between 75.01% and 80%**

**We won't accept further advance applications in the following circumstances:**
  * If your client has a product switch application in progress (further advance applications will be reviewed after the switch is completed)
  * Capital raising for business purposes (if you're unsure, please contact [Broker Chat](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/support/broker-chat) to discuss prior to submission)
  * Applications with more than two clients
  * Where a further advance and change of borrower (also known as a transfer of equity) have been requested at the same time, either transaction must have completed before applying for the other. **Please note** that both a change of borrower (transfer of equity) request and further advance application will be assessed based on the relevant criteria at the time of submission.
  * Regulated Buy to Let applications
  * Where the requested further advance term exceeds the longest term on any existing mortgage accounts linked to the property. If the term exceeds this, we'll reduce it to the closest whole year to the main loan.
  * If the existing mortgage term has less than 5 years remaining. The existing term will need to be extended to 5 years or more prior to submission of the further advance application.

#### Affordability assessment
To ensure your client can cover the additional monthly mortgage interest payment, we'll stress the existing loan based on the term and the overall LTV.

See more information on our rental checks.

**Stress Rates:**
For further advances, we'll continue to stress individual loan elements separately. However, the stress rate applied to existing lending will be set to a minimum of the stress rate applicable to the new borrowing.

Please download our [further advance calculator](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/t1203-further-advance-calculator.xlsx?rev=2e74460f628942ea9bee0a66148745db&hash=E45A7C29CED39B6A01D5F81DCCF8818F) for support calculating potential further borrowing.

#### How to apply
Applications for further advances are submitted to Full Mortgage Application through [TMW Online (opens in a new window)](https://www.tmwonline.co.uk).

**Key points:**
  * There's no DIP produced, as the decision is made once the application is received and assessed (including a new valuation and a credit search).
  * Further advance applications are valid for **six months** from the date of the first offer.
  * After submitting a further advance, you'll need to wait **six months** after the payment has been made on the original loan before submitting another.
  * You can only submit a maximum of **two further advances in a year**, and **four further advances in a three-year period**.
  * If you wish to provide your client with a Mortgage Illustration, you can request one using our Manual Mortgage Illustration request form.
  * For more information on the fees your client may have to pay, view our [Tariff of Charges](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/t21-tariff-of-charges.pdf?rev=4c77f29564554eeca6392b0c335a3b41&hash=0093D6D6F9463680DED387373BAAA24C).

#### Rate switches and further advances
If your client is looking to complete a rate switch and a further advance, these are two separate applications and you'll need to decide which to do first.

**Important considerations:**
  * If you complete a rate switch application first, we're unable to guarantee that a further advance application will be accepted subsequently.
  * Completing a further advance first may mean that any subsequent rate switch could be charged at a higher rate due to the increased LTV. The further advance will need to have completed prior to a rate switch application.
  * If your clients have started a further advance application but don't want to continue with this as they would rather proceed with a Rate Switch, we'll require instructions from your clients to cancel the application. This can be included with the paper application form for the product switch.

#### Drawdown of funds
You can email a copy of the completed Further Advance Release form to **tmw-completions@themortgageworks.co.uk**.

**To avoid delays in your completion, please ensure the subject field of the email includes:**
  * The case reference number
  * And that it states one of the below:
    * COT
    * Certificate of title
    * Report on title
    * Release of funds form

**Funds release timing:**
  * We'll require **five working days notice** when submitting a further advance release.
  * We'll release the funds on:
    * the same day as completion if you select a working day
    * the next working day if you select Sunday or a Bank Holiday
    * the Friday before if you select a Saturday.

**Important requirements:**
  * All applicants on the offer must sign a 'Further Advance release request'.
  * The bank details on the release form should match the Direct Debit details held on the main loan.
  * An offer is valid for **6 Months**, so completion should be within this time. We may be able to offer a short extension if needed.
  * We'll need to check there are no arrears on the main loan before we can release the funds.
  * You'll need to ensure you have fulfilled any special conditions before requesting any further advance funds.
  * Where a solicitor is acting in the transaction, we can release the advance to the solicitor.

#### Funds release
If you or the solicitor emails us requesting funds release, please ensure the subject line includes:
  * Our **8 digit reference number**
  * The words, **'Funds release form'**

Failure to include this information may delay completion.

#### EPC Requirements
All further advance applications require a valid EPC before submission. The Valuer will be unable to recommend the property as a suitable security without a valid EPC. We'll reconsider the property once you provide a valid EPC.

We'll consider applications where a property's EPC rating is outside of our policy, subject to the following:
  * **For applications at 75% LTV or below:** if the EPC rating is F or G, we'll only accept a further advance where the sole purpose of the additional borrowing is to fund improvements to make the property compliant with EPC minimum standards of E rated or above.
  * **For applications over 75% LTV:** if the EPC rating is D, E, F or G, we'll only accept a Green Further Advance application where the sole purpose is to fund improvements to make the property compliant with our policy of C rated or above.

#### HMO Applications
All HMO applications, including Further Advances, require a Specialist Security valuation, which is payable by the client. For Further Advance and Remortgage applications, before carrying out a valuation, we'll require a copy of the HMO licence.

Further advance applications for HMO require payment of the full specialist security valuation fee.

#### Limited Company
Further advances on Limited Company mortgages are accepted.

#### Foreign Nationals
Exceptions to the 65% LTV limitation will be considered for Further Advance applications where there is work required to maintain the property.

#### Fire Safety
For further advances, we'll consider applications if the funds are being raised to carry out the required remedial works.

The valuer will assess the EPC data and detail any works needed to bring the property to the minimum standards above in the valuation report. We'll reflect the costs of any works in the valuation figure.

### Income Criteria

#### Interest Cover Ratio (ICR)
To reflect the different taxable income levels of applicants, we have a range of ICRs that are applicable depending on the customer and/or application. We'll class all personal applications where the client owns more than three rental properties (with or without a mortgage), as a higher rate taxpayer.

The gross rental income, confirmed by the valuer, must cover the monthly mortgage interest payment by at least:

**ICR** | **Buy to Let and Let to Buy** | **HMO and Limited Company HMO** | **Limited Company Buy to Let**
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Lower rate tax** | **125%** | **160%** | **125%**
**Higher rate tax** | **175%** | **175%** | **125%**

**125% ICR** applies to all Limited Company applications (except Houses in Multiple Occupation). And those in personal names where the following criteria is met:
  * Applicants declare themselves to be Lower rate taxpayers and;
  * Declaring their gross annual income is less than £50,271 per applicant, upon completion of the mortgage. This is less than £43,662 gross income in Scotland.
  * Personal applicants can have **no more than 3 rental properties** (with or without a mortgage). This includes any The Mortgage Works applications in progress.

Of the existing buy to let income input at Decision in principle stage, we'll take into account the following in our assessment of an applicant's overall income:
  * 75% of all rental income. This includes existing and proposed buy to lets with The Mortgage Works.
  * 100% of all other sources of income.

#### Additional ICR information
In order to ensure the correct ICR is applied to the application, you need to key 100% of all existing BTL income.

For purchase and Let to Buy applications we'll add 75% of the new property's proposed gross rental income to the applicants' annual income.

For joint applications, we'll add half of the 75% proposed gross rental income to each applicants' annual income.

We'll treat any applicant that has recently left employment, retired or started self-employment as a higher rate taxpayer.

View our [Portfolio landlord criteria page](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/portfolio-landlords) to see the rental calculations and maximum LTVs for portfolio landlords.

#### Stress rates
When calculating affordability, we apply a range of stress rates depending on application type, loan purpose, term and loan to value.

#### Buy to Let, Let to Buy, Large Portfolio and HMO applications
We'll always use whichever is the higher of stress rate or pay rate (pay rate +2.00% where applicable).

Loan purpose | Term | Loan to Value (LTV) | Stress rate
--- | --- | --- | ---
Like for like remortgage* | All fixed | 65% LTV or lower | 4.00% or pay rate
 | | Higher than 65% LTV | 4.50% or pay rate
Purchase, Remortgage with capital raising **or** Further advance | 1 and 2 year fixed | All LTVs | 5.50% or pay rate +2.00%
 | 5 year fixed | 65% LTV or lower | 4.00% or pay rate

*For 2 year fixed Let to Buy and Large Portfolio Let to Buy products on a like for like remortgage, we'll use 5.50% or pay rate +2.00%.

#### Limited Company Buy to Let and Limited Company HMO applications
Loan purpose | Term | Loan to Value (LTV) | Stress rate
--- | --- | --- | ---
Like for like remortgage | All fixed | All LTVs | 4.50% or pay rate
Purchase, Further advance | 1 and 2 year fixed | All LTVs | 5.50% or pay rate +2.00%
 | 5 year fixed | All LTVs | 4.50% or pay rate

#### Tracker and variables
Tracker and variable products have a stress rate of 5.50% or pay rate +2.00%. We'll always use whichever is the higher.

#### Further advances
We'll continue to stress individual loan elements separately in line with the above. However, the stress rate applied to existing lending will be set to a minimum of the stress rate applicable to the new borrowing.

Please download our [further advance calculator](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/t1203-further-advance-calculator.xlsx?rev=2e74460f628942ea9bee0a66148745db&hash=E45A7C29CED39B6A01D5F81DCCF8818F) for support calculating potential further borrowing.

#### Pay rates
Check our [product finder](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/products/product-finder) to find out what the pay rate is for your product.

#### Minimum income
There is no minimum personal income requirement. Proof of personal income may be requested to support an application. We'll use this with other information relating to the landlord and the property. This is to validate that the loan is going to be used for its intended purpose.

**Non-portfolio applications:**
We'll carry out further underwriting. We may require additional proofs to support sustainability by requesting **one or more of the following** evidence:
  * 3 months' bank statements
  * Personal savings to support 6 months' rental income
  * Additional household income*
  * Available household funds to act as a sinking fund.*

* We'll only consider household income/sinking fund where the third party is a spouse/ partner of the applicant. They'll need to hold a joint residential mortgage with them.

We may decline the application if we consider the exposure to be too high. For example, where they have a large residential mortgage solely owned. Or a large amount of unsecured debt not consistent with the household income.

See [Income Proofs](#income-proofs) section for detailed information on acceptable income types and proof requirements.

## LET TO BUY CRITERIA
 MAIN URL: https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/a-z#let-to-buy-criteria
 SOURCE: The Mortgage Works (Nationwide Building Society)

### Let to Buy Criteria
If your client is a first time or experienced landlord looking to remortgage their existing main residence as a Buy to Let property and purchase a new residential property, we can help. You'll find our full range of options in the 'Let to Buy' section of our [product finder](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/products/product-finder).

**Tip:** Applications where the new residential property will be purchased with cash are considered provided the current main residence is unencumbered and the onward purchase is not a private sale.

#### Key criteria

**How much will we loan?**
  * The maximum LTV we'll consider for Let to Buy mortgages is 80%. See our table for [maximum loan amount per property](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/general#maxiLoanProperty).

**What you should know:**
  * **The same solicitor must act on behalf of your client for both purchase and remortgage transactions.**
  * Applicants must've owned and lived in their residential property for at least six months (with or without a mortgage) at the time they apply.
  * We'll only accept applications where there's a simultaneous onward purchase of a new residential property (with another lender), address to be supplied on application and confirmed by the acting solicitor prior to completion.
  * Applicants must leave the address on which the loan is secured upon completion - and provide us with a new correspondence address.
  * If the new residential property is bought using a mortgage, a copy of the onward residential mortgage offer must be provided prior to completion.
  * The onward property must be immediately habitable - and this must be confirmed either by the property's sales literature or a physical valuation/Home Survey Level 2 Report (which replaced the Homebuyer Report).
  * The names on both the onward purchase and The Mortgage Works mortgage should match. Any variance in ownership can be considered prior to application.
  * Joint applications, or applications where the onward purchase is in joint names, can only be submitted if the applicants are partners.
  * The applicant's main residence must not be listed for sale on the open market or sold subject to contract.
  * To submit cases simultaneously for The Mortgage Works and Nationwide for Intermediaries applications, please read our [Let to Buy processing guide](https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/-/media/tmw/documents/db54-let-to-buy-process-guide.pdf?rev=9c9d0d3b71434bb79ba9a028d048ec6b&hash=66CE6241EBCB627A92F0B490346D4768).
  * Where the applicant is using the lower 125% ICR, proof of personal income is required, but in all other cases we don't normally need this. **Please note:** if we do need to see proof of personal income for another reason then we'll ask you to send this to us.
  * Applications where the new residential property will be purchased with cash are considered, provided:
    * The current main residence is unencumbered
    * The onward purchase is not a private sale.

## VALUATION CRITERIA
 MAIN URL: https://www.themortgageworks.co.uk/intermediaries/lending-criteria/a-z#valuation-criteria
 SOURCE: The Mortgage Works (Nationwide Building Society)

### Valuation Criteria
  * Leasehold properties must have a minimum lease of 70 years at application.
  * The valuer must be satisfied that there is a market for any property taking the lease term into consideration.
  * Although an application may meet the guidelines above, the property may still be declined by the valuer, e.g. a mortgage application in England for a 20 year term with a 71 year unexpired lease is within policy, but the valuer may advise the property is not readily marketable and saleable and we will therefore not consider the property as suitable security.

For detailed valuation information including fees, policy, and appeals, please see the [Valuation](#valuation), [Valuation Fees](#valuation-fees), [Valuation Policy](#valuation-policy), and [Valuation Appeals](#valuation-appeals) sections.
