### Criteria Search tool

* Criteria Search (intermediaries): https://www.darlington.co.uk/darlington-intermediaries/criteria-search/
* Quick and easy criteria finder: search lending criteria by product type (Residential or Buy to Let).
* Search alphabetically (A–Z) or use the search function to check whether a client meets the Society’s requirements before submitting an application.
* Use the tool to identify lending options and case suitability for buy to let and other products.
