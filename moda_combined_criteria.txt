### Affordability

**Interest coverage ratio (ICR)**

The minimum amount of rental cover (ICR) is dependent on the applicant's income tax band (highest tax band on joint applications) at the rates shown below:

* Basic rate taxpayers: 125%
* Higher and additional rate taxpayers: 140%
* Limited companies: 125%

The applicant's tax band should be based on all validated current income plus gross rental income (excluding any deductions) from all rental properties, including the security. Refer to our buy to let calculator for further guidance.

The interest rate used in the ICR calculation is determined by the chosen product as follows:

* 5 year fixed rates assessed at product rate
* Variable rates or short-term fixed rates assessed at product rate plus 2%. Minimum 5.50%

Where the applicant is remortgaging an existing buy to let loan without additional capital raising, then the ICR can be calculated using the product rate for applications up to 80% LTV gross

Where more than the rental income is needed to meet the minimum rental cover requirements, we may reduce the loan amount accordingly

Valuations are valid for six months

A new valuation may be required where mortgage offers are extended

We retain the right to request original documentation

If any documentation is required to verify income, deposit or account conduct, we'll tell you during the online application.
