# SECTION 6 – LEGAL FEES

## For buy to let landlords purchasing / remortgaging property through the Residential Portal (X case reference)

We can use the applicant's solicitors to act on behalf of Aldermore, subject to them being on our wider panel, or by them meeting our qualification criteria to join.

Where applicant(s) choose to nominate a Conveyancer that does not qualify (or is not accepted) onto our panel, we will require separate legal representation, based on the fees detailed in our legal fees scale.

### For purchase

Applicants can select to use one of Aldermore's managed panel solicitors to act for themselves and the bank or choose to instruct their own solicitor to act. This is subject to them being on Aldermore's approved panel.

Free legals are not available on Purchase transactions.

### For remortgage

We offer free legals via our managed panel Solicitors.

Aldermore will instruct our own conveyancer and pay for the costs of the legal work necessary to move the mortgage to Aldermore (the property does not have to be currently mortgaged), including disbursements (e.g., Land Registry fees) and VAT.

We will use title and search insurance to remove the need for local authority and other searches. Title and search insurance will be for the benefit of Aldermore.

## Legal fees - for buy to let landlords (individuals and companies) purchasing / remortgaging through the Specialist buy to let Portal (Y case reference)

### For purchase

Borrowers can use their own conveyancers to represent both themselves and the bank. The selected conveyancer must be registered with Aldermore via Lender Exchange, and meet the following criteria:

* A minimum of two SRA approved managers or two CLC authorised managers (details can be checked at: lawsociety.org.uk or clc-uk.org.uk).
* Conveyancing Quality Scheme (CQS) accreditation (applicable to solicitors only).
* Minimum PI insurance cover for £2m, the conveyancer must at all times retain professional indemnity insurance cover which is adequate and appropriate for the practice, considering in particular the nature and value of the work they are undertaking.

Assisted legal fees are not available on purchase transactions.

### For remortgage

We offer assisted legal fees for Company buy to let transactions. We'll appoint our own solicitor to act for Aldermore Bank only, but they can also act for the borrower for an additional fee if required.

Independent Legal Advice and Personal Guarantees are required. These are available through our conveyancer and cost £250 plus VAT.

For any non-assisted legal fee transactions, please select your own conveyancer as above.

For any transaction not using assisted legal fees, the borrower will be liable for all conveyancing costs.

### Model Articles

The 'model articles' as set out by the Companies Act 2006, sets out what a director is authorised to do on behalf of the company. At present there is a challenge as to the clauses held within the standard model articles, therefore, a sole director, under the unamended model articles, does not have the power to enter into contracts - including mortgage deeds.

In order to proceed on these transactions, we will require the model articles to be amended to allow the director to enter into contracts, as a sole director. Amending an article can generally be done within a week depending on the response from the borrower, and the ability to sign resolutions and submit amendments online. A set of board minutes and a board resolution recording the amendment must be completed and submitted to Companies House. This process is normally carried out via a Conveyancer. Please refer to our buy to let conveyancing guide for details on potential costs.

See our buy to let conveyancing guide for more information.

# SECTION 7 – LEGAL Q&As

## How can I check if my applicant's solicitors are on your panel for a case I've submitted?

Your nominated solicitor will represent Aldermore and your client. You can see which firms are on our panel by searching on **lender exchange**, either by solicitor's name or postcode. If they appear on this list, they are on our panel.

If they aren't on the panel, please register them before offer to prevent delays.

## Why does my client have to wait until the offer is issued before your free/assisted legal solicitor is instructed?

Our agreement with our free legal partners is that a mortgage offer is required before we contact the solicitor.

## How do I choose and instruct a solicitor for a buy to let transaction submitted through your Specialist buy to let portal (Y case reference)?

You can choose to instruct your own solicitor to act dual representation for yourself and the bank. Please enter their details during the application process, ensuring that they meet our qualification criteria as noted earlier in this document.
