## Lending Criteria Overview

With our soft searches and flexible criteria, let's see if we can help you with those tricky-to-place cases.

At the decision in principle (DIP) stage, we ensure our actions don't leave a 'hard' footprint on your client's credit file. This non-intrusive approach allows you to discover what you can achieve.

### Adverse Credit Criteria

| Criteria | Acceptable |
|:---------|:-----------|
| Mortgage or secured loan arrears | 2 in 24 |
| Unsecured loan arrears | 2 in 24 |
| CCJ | Single satisfied CCJ <£500 may be considered. CCJs above £500 must be satisfied for at least three years |
| Defaults | Satisfied defaults up to £250 may be considered where there are none for a mortgage, secured or unsecured loans. Defaults >£250 must be satisfied for at least three years |
| Bankruptcy | Discharged for three years |

**Note:** We only need the discharge certificate for applicants who were previously declared bankrupt. No documents are required for all other criteria points.

### Minimum Packaging Requirements

Check our [minimum packaging guide](https://www.thenottingham.com/media/h3hnc0kw/minimum-packaging-guides.pdf) to find out what documents you need to submit with your application. This will help us provide a speedier underwriting decision.
