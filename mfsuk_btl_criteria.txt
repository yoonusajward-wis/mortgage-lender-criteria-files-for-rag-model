## Loan Details

### Loan Purpose

Purchase or remortgage, including capital raising if 40% or less is for personal reasons.

### Gross Loan Size

Gross loan amount for buy-to-let mortgage criteria:

**Minimum:** £150k (£100k by referral).

**Maximum:**

Aggregate max. £10m with Market Financial Solutions for each Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO).

The gross loan includes product fee, any rolled and/or deferred interest. The net loan (advanced on day 1) is reduced by the total of these capitalised amounts (and any optional broker fee) to ensure sufficient equity remains in the property.

* Residential: £3m per property
* Commercial: £2m per property

### LTV

**Residential:** Max. 75% LTV (based on the gross loan).

**Commercial:** Max. 70% LTV (based on the gross loan).

Product fee is capitalised and included in the gross loan.

### Terms

Max. 10 or 25 years in total, depending on product. No ERC after initial rate period.

### Capital Raising

Yes, as long as <40% of the loan amount is for personal reasons.

### Debt Consolidation

Allowed, as long as they meet our maximum adverse credit criteria. Personal debts subject to being less than 40% of total loan size.

### Charge Types

We currently offer BTL loans on first charge only.

### 2nd Charge

Currently not considered for BTL mortgages.

### Repayment Types

Interest Only (I/O) by monthly Direct Debit from a UK account. If loan has rolled up months of interest, direct debit will start after the rolled months have passed.

### Interest Payments

Serviced monthly via direct debit from a UK bank account. If any months of interest are rolled and added to the loan, direct debit will start after those months have elapsed.

### Deferred Interest

Up to 2%.

Example: 8.99% full rate with 2% deferred becomes a pay rate of 6.99% for initial 2 years. ICR is calculated on the reduced pay rate. Deferred part of monthly interest payments in initial 2 years are capitalised (added to the loan) and paid when the loan is redeemed. Can help cashflow or simply allow a larger loan size as rent versus monthly payment generated a higher ICR (see ICR section).

### Rolled Interest

Roll-up 1 to 9 months payments possible, depending on product.

Rolled up months of interest are added to the loan and paid when the loan is redeemed. Can help cashflow, time for light refurbishments/EPC improvement, find a tenant, or simply allow a larger loan size (see ICR section). Direct debit starts after rolled months have elapsed.

### Overpayments

Yes, up to 10% p.a. without incurring ERC. No limit/ERC after initial rate period.

### ERC Early Repayment Charges

* 3-year fixed: 4%/3%/2%. No ERC during revert rate period.
* 2-year fixed: 4%/3%. No ERC during revert rate period.
* Tracker: 3%/2.5%. No ERC during revert rate period.

### Exit Fee

No exit fee.

### Exit Strategy

We consider multiple viable exit routes.

### Remortgaging

Remortgage within 6 months: £ for £ bridge exit is fine, fees can be added to bridge settlement figure. Non-bridge considered with clear evidence of improvements (valuer confirmation), funds paper trail, or bought a part-exchange from housebuilder etc.

---

## Fees

### Admin Fee

* Residential BTL: £199 per property (max £995), non-refundable, paid with val fee.
* Commercial BTL: £250 per property (max £1250), non-refundable, paid with val fee.

### Arrangement Fee

Product fees are applicable on each of our tiers, please see the latest rate tables for up-to-date figures.

### Legal Costs

We provide quotes upon application to find the appropriate solicitor firm to represent Market Financial Solutions from a small panel, suitable for the transaction type and timescales required. We do not permit dual representation due to the complex nature of our BTL transactions (e.g. any conflict of interest that may arise can result in abandoned transactions, lost time and incurred fees with dual rep).

---

## Credit History

### Adverse Credit

As part of our buy-to-let mortgage criteria the underwriter can consider cases with BKO/IVA/DRO/Previous Repossession/recent CCJs or mortgage arrears on their merits on the higher tiers, subject to Credit Committee approval.

Refer to tiers for limits. All adverse and CCJs, excluding small unsecured blips, must be cleared at completion – Market Financial Solutions funds can be used. Adverse is combined (all persons/Ltd Co's), and small blips can be ignored for tier selection (see rate grid). Require explanation of mortgage exit strategy, current stability, and credit committee approval (usually under 48hrs). Pay day loans considered if infrequent, historic and cleared.

### Credit Check

We require a credit check as part of our loan application process.

---

## Rental Income and Affordability

### Rental Income

Sufficient to meet our ICR requirement.

### ICR

**Tracker Rates:** Minimum ICR is 130%

**Fixed Rates:** ICR is 125%

Minimum ICR limit is the same regardless of corporate or individual, location of applicant, tax status etc.

Calculated as total rent income over the initial rate period, divided by total interest due over same period. However, the total interest due in the initial 24 month term can be reduced by rolling up months of interest or deferring part of the interest rate; this can increase the ICR, enabling a larger loan as long as the resulting ICR is above our minimum. These tools can also help if the valuation comes in lower than expected.

Depending on the product, we can allow deferred interest (see max loan calculator for limits) to reduce the interest due over the initial 2 year term – boosting max loan. E.g. a rate of 8.99% with 2% deferred results in a pay rate of 6.99%.

**Top slicing:** surplus portfolio rents, salary or savings/wealth can be considered to boost the rent by up to 20%. Refer to underwriter.

Alternatively, or in addition, roll-up and defer up to 6 months (9 months by referral) interest payments - direct debit starts after roll-up period.

Any deferred/rolled months of interest are capitalised (added) to the loan and paid at redemption. Loan advance reduced to preserve property equity to protect Market Financial Solutions and the borrower.

Direct Debit (DD) payments normally start after the deferred months to provide time to find a tenant or light renovation.

We reserve the right to increase minimum ICR for expats & foreign nationals with a limited UK footprint.

### Top-Slicing

Surplus salary, savings/wealth, or surplus portfolio rent considered to support Market Financial Solutions' loan(s) if properties wholly owned by same applicants, and not used as top-up for other lenders. Can boost rent by maximum 20% to improve ICR. Refer to underwriter to consider top-slicing.
