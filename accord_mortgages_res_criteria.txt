Where the valuer has requested an EWS1 form due to the cladding being present on the property the following guidance will apply. 

A completed EWS1 form will be required from a member of a relevant professional body, along with a covering letter on headed paper which will confirm they are suitably qualified. This will then be assessed by our underwriters. 

If an EWS1 form is not available for a new build property a letter from the developer can now be accepted. This is subject to the letter being on a headed letter with the developer's company details clearly present. The letter must confirm that the property is being built in accordance with the Building (Amendment) Regulations SI 2018/1230 and/or, that there are no materials included in the building of the flats that would cause an EWS1 form to be unsuitable.

## Japanese knotweed

If Japanese knotweed is present at the property, the valuer must confirm what category/stage the knotweed is at and the following rules must be applied; 

  * Category A and B – The property may be considered as acceptable for mortgage purposes, subject to an inspection by a suitably qualified remediation specialist and commitment shown to the start of any recommended works under an insurance backed Japanese knotweed Management Plan.
  * Category C and D – Acceptable to lend.

If the valuer identifies a heavy stand of Japanese knotweed on neighbouring land (e.g. very close to the boundary) that may present a threat, the subject property should be declined.

## Tyneside flats

Accord Mortgages will require a charge to be taken over the freehold in addition to a charge over the leasehold title.

## Unacceptable new build developments

Unfortunately, we are unable to accept applications for some new build developments.

Use our handy [New build development checker tool](https://www.accordmortgages.com/tools/new-build-development-checker) to check before you submit an application.

## Steel framed

An Intrusive Structural Report (in accordance with BRE113) must be obtained on all pre-1980 steel.

## Mundic

Mundic Properties are of concrete block construction, often found in Cornwall and Devon. Concrete deteriorates and in the worst cases the property may need to be demolished. 

If a test is required by the valuer this must be obtained before mortgage offer. 

We consider the gradings as follows:

A - Acceptable

A/B - Should be referred to the valuer to check it doesn't affect his valuation

B and below - Not acceptable

## Pre-cast concrete

Precast reinforced concrete properties, designated under the Housing Act 1985, part XVI are acceptable if the property has undergone licensed repairs. If the property is a flat, or adjoined to an unrepaired PRC property, then it is unacceptable, regardless of a report.

Many different types of construction are now being designed and developed employing off-site manufacture. These often have a timber or a light gauge steel frame, with a variety of claddings. Such properties are acceptable subject to a satisfactory report from the valuer confirming their saleability and demand.

Ideally, the property should be approved under (BOPAS) Buildoffsite Property Assurance Scheme which means that it has passed a 60 year durability assessment and has a 12 year structural warranty.

Acceptability will be reviewed by the Group's valuers based upon:

* Planning/Building regulation compliance

* Acceptability to other mainstream lenders
* 60 years minimum design life assessment tested by a British accredited body (i.e. BBA or BRE)
* Satisfactory construction standards, site and valuation.

## Acceptable incentives for New builds

Acceptable builders incentives:

* For houses and bungalows: the maximum allowable builder's incentive is 5%. If the total value of incentives exceeds 5% of the purchase price, the difference should be deducted from the purchase price and LTV calculated on the lower figure
* For flats and maisonettes: where the builder's incentive is cash back or deposit paid, this is not acceptable unless the full incentive is deducted from the purchase price to calculate the loan to value. Any other incentives must not exceed 5%.

## Unacceptable new build developments

Unfortunately, we are unable to accept applications for some new build developments.

# SECTION 21 – LETTING


## Consent to let out

**Allowed:**
* Your client can apply for consent to let whilst holding a residential mortgage. They will need to complete an application form and if granted a loading of up to 1% will be applied to the current mortgage rate.

**Condition (unauthorised lets):**
* Unauthorised lets can be chargeable with a loading of up to 2%.

Please direct your client to [Renting out your home](https://www.accordmortgages.com/existing-customers/renting-out-your-home) where further details can be found.

## Property already let out

**Condition:**
* The following criteria for let properties is subject to our underwriters discretion and we may make exceptions in certain circumstances. We normally expect all existing mortgages to be self-financing.

**Condition (outstanding mortgage ignored):**
* The outstanding mortgage(s) can be ignored if the property is already let from the date of application and the monthly rental amount is at least 145% of the monthly mortgage payment at 5% interest*.

**Condition (rent below 145%):**
* Where the monthly rental payment does not cover mortgage payments by 145% at an interest of 5%*, we will calculate the deduction as the monthly mortgage payment multiplied by 145% minus the monthly rental income. If the rental income does not meet at least 100% of the calculation the full mortgage payment will be taken as a commitment.

\*As the majority of Buy to Let properties are mortgaged on an interest only basis, we use an interest rate of 5% on the outstanding mortgage (as evidenced on the credit records) to determine if the rental income meets the 145% rule.

**Condition (evidence – property already let):**
The applicant(s) may be asked to provide:

* Bank statements for the period that the property has been let
* Evidence of the last 12 months mortgage payments

## Let to buy (LTB)

**Allowed:**
* Let to Buy (LTB) applications are acceptable.

**Condition (rent cover):**
* The anticipated monthly rent should cover the monthly mortgage payment by 145% at an interest rate of 5%*. If it does not we will calculate the deduction as the monthly mortgage payment multiplied by 145% minus the monthly rental income. If the rental income does not meet at least 100% of the calculation the full mortgage payment will be taken as a commitment.

\*As the majority of Buy to let properties are mortgaged on an interest only basis, we use an interest rate of 5% on the outstanding mortgage (as evidenced on the credit records) to determine if the rental income meets the 145% rule.

**Condition (evidence – LTB):**
The applicant(s) may be asked to provide:

* Verification of rental Income - A copy of the rental valuation document which must have been completed by an ARLA registered agent
