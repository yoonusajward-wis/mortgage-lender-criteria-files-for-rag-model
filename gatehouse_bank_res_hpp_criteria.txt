## SECTION 7 – How It Works

### 7.1 Acquisition & Rent Purchase Plan

* The Bank and the applicant each contribute a percentage towards the purchase or refinance (e.g. Bank 75%, applicant 25%; for refinances the applicant's contribution is the equity in the property).
* The Bank leases its share to the applicant for the finance term. The applicant makes monthly Acquisition Payments; the Bank's share diminishes and the applicant's share increases. The Bank charges rent on its share until acquired.
* The applicant may acquire the Bank's share early via Additional Acquisition Payments (AAPs) or at term end. An Early Redemption Charge (ERC) may apply if the Bank's share is acquired in full or AAPs exceed the 10% annual allowance during the Fixed Rental Rate Period. When the Bank's share is fully acquired, the Bank transfers the registered title to the applicant.

### 7.2 Notes

* On settlement, an Account Settlement Fee is payable per the Bank's Tariff of Charges. Minimum Additional Acquisition Payment (AAP) is £2,000.
* The customer is responsible for solicitor costs, stamp duty and other conveyancing charges (e.g. land registry fees) at outset and on settlement.
