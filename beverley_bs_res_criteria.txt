AFFORDABILITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Affordability Assessment - Stressed Payment Level:
- Stress Rate: The Society calculates affordability at a stress payment rate of our standard variable rate (SVR) plus 1%

Affordability Assessment - Loan-to-Income Ratio:
- Standard LTI Ratio: Usually apply a loan-to-income (LTI) ratio of 4.49x or less
- Higher LTIs: Will consider higher LTIs, subject to status, for 'trapped borrowers' or in other exceptional cases, at the discretion of our Head of Lending

Affordability Assessment - Qualifying Income:
- Acceptable Income Sources: Will consider qualifying income from employment, self-employment, investments, pensions, rental income, foster income - or a combination of these - as part of our affordability assessment

Affordability Assessment - Investment Income:
- Non-Guaranteed Income: Will accept non-guaranteed qualifying income from pensions and investments, but will apply a 10% reduction to anticipated income protections, to allow for the impact of potential market downturns

Income Verification:
- Required: Income to be verified in all cases
- Self-Certified Applications: Will not accept self-certified mortgage applications
- Probationary Period: Applicants in a probationary period will be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account affordability and previous continuity of employment
- Evidence Required: All applicants must provide evidence of their income and track record of maintaining existing credit arrangements, to confirm that they can afford their desired mortgage

Income Assessment - In and Into Retirement:
- Maximum Income Multiple: Will lend a maximum of four-times income
- Employed Income: Will only take employed income into account up to the age of 75
- Other Forms of Income: Will consider other forms of non-salaried income, such as rental income, investments and pensions, so long as it is expected to continue. Will consider cases such as professional landlords or company directors who are not physically working but derive income from their involvement/investments, at the discretion of our Head of Lending
- Pension Income: Look at the certainty of ongoing pension income, including the potential exhaustion of draw-down pension pots. Will ask for pension valuation statements dated within one month of the mortgage application. Apply a 10% 'haircut' to the value of any income that is not guaranteed
- Joint Mortgages: Where the mortgage is in joint names, also assess the affordability of both borrowers to ensure that they could continue to maintain their payments should the other die. Will consider a declaration that they will sell the property and downsize in this event as acceptable for affordability purposes

Qualifying Income:
- Acceptable Sources: Will consider income from employment, self-employment, investments, pensions, rental income, or a combination of these, as part of our affordability assessment

- Rising Income: If income has risen, year-on-year, will normally apply the most recent income level, unless there has been a significant increase which needs an explanation and consideration that this is to continue
- Significant Increase: If income has risen, year-on-year, will normally apply the most recent income level, although a review by our risk director may be required in cases where the latest year's income is more than 20 per cent higher than previous ones
- Income Calculation: In general, will apply the applicant's share of net profit, salary and dividends for multiplier and affordability purposes

REPAYMENT AND TERM
================================================================================

Interest-Only Lending:
- Declaration Required: Require interest-only borrowers to declare, in writing, how they intend to repay their mortgage at the end of the term, and for all parties to sign this written document. In introduced cases, these signatures must be witnessed by the broker
- Maximum LTV: 70% for interest-only mortgages
- Downsizing as Repayment Vehicle: Where downsizing is to be used for repayment, require minimum equity of £150,000 – or more, depending on typical house prices in the borrower's local area
- Other Repayment Vehicles:
  1. Savings and investments held for at least two years, evidenced by statements, held in the names of all borrowers and in British pounds, where the value is at least equal to the loan advance or the lowest projections predict it will be so, evidenced by statements from within the past 12 months. Do not accept high-risk investments such as those involving single stock, or which are exotic in nature or speculative
     * Documentary evidence required:
       - Managed investment plans, unit trusts, open-ended investment companies, investment bonds and stocks and shares ISAs: statements less than 12 months old
       - Managed share holdings: copies of share certificates, nominated account statements or confirmation from an authorised stockbroker evidencing holdings and valuation
       - Endowment policies: latest projected pension value statement, dated within one month of the mortgage application
     * Note: Where affordability is being assessed on the basis of non-guaranteed investments, will apply a 10% haircut to values, to safeguard against any downward movement
  2. Sale of other property, where the property is based in England and Wales. Require evidence of equity and, in some cases, will carry out our own valuation and, if mortgaged, review the most recent statements
  3. Sale of the mortgaged property. Will only consider downsizing as a means of meeting affordability where the borrower has at least £150,000 of equity in it, up to an overall maximum LTV of 70%. When the property is sold, the borrower will need to commit to repaying their existing mortgage and demonstrate that this will give them sufficient funds to purchase a new home

Retirement Interest-Only (RIO) Lending:
- Description: These are interest-only loans which only need to be repaid when the borrower dies, moves into long-term care or sells their house
- Criteria: All of the criteria applicable to our other forms of lending into retirement apply to RIO loans, with the addition of the following restrictions:
  * Minimum Eligible Age: 55
  * Maximum Borrowers: A maximum of two borrowers and no other occupiers of the property (although the Society may consent to a family carer residing at the property, subject to them providing an appropriately-worded, signed Occupiers' Consent form confirming that they have no interest in the property and will vacate on the death or move into care of the borrower(s), or when the property is sold)
  * Maximum LTV: 60%, or 30% where the property is located within a retirement complex
  * Minimum Property Valuation: £125,000
  * Minimum Loan Size: £25,000 (purchase) and £40,000 (remortgage)
  * Flats: If the mortgageable property is a flat, it must have lift access if not on the ground floor
  * Acceptable Income for RIO:
    - Net income from buy-to-let property
    - Pension income
    - Other forms of non-salaried income, investments such as stocks and shares ISAs, defined contribution, pensions etc. – where we will apply a 10% 'haircut' as a reasonable allowance for any potential fluctuations in value

Floor Rate:
- Policy: During any discounted payment period the Society will operate a floor rate. This means that, the discounted interest rate will not fall below a specified level, as shown in our product details

- Requirements:
  * The customer's mortgage existed before 26 April 2014
