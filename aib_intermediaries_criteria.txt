**Calculating net income for self-employed customers:**

```
Self Employed Net Profit
+ Depreciation
+ Loan Interest
-----------------------------------
Sub Total
- Loan/HP Rep
-----------------------------------
Gross Income
- Tax
-----------------------------------
Net Income
(Divide by 12 for monthly)
```

**Note:** An average of the past 3 years' surplus available to the applicants should be used for the affordability calculation. In cases where there are significant changes in profitability trends these should be referred to our Run By desk in order to agree a sustainable income figure.

## Other income

**Only income earned in Pounds Sterling (£) from employment / investments in the UK will be accepted for affordability purposes.**

The following income types may be taken into account for affordability purposes. Income must be evidenced on Bank statements for all "Other Income" sources.

* Lifetime DLA (Proof - Regular lodgements to bank account)

If customer is less than six months in current employment, their employer will be required to confirm that applicant has successfully completed Probation and is confirmed in permanent employment. This confirmation can be by way of [AIB (NI) Salary Certificate](https://aibni.co.uk/content/dam/aibni/intermediary/Documents/forms-and-packaging/salary-certificate.pdf) or by letter on company headed paper.

## Maternity / Paternity leave

Where an applicant is on maternity/paternity leave, we accept the applicant's normal pay subject to the following:
* The applicant will be returning to work within 6 months of the initial application date
* Letter from employer confirming when the applicant will return to work and confirmation of salary on return to work

## Income from multiple sources

AIB for Intermediaries will consider more than one source of income per applicant, provided they meet our acceptable income criteria and can be evidenced in line with our standard proof of income criteria.

## Affordability

Establishing affordability is the key factor in assessing repayment capacity and the following criteria should be met when assessing a mortgage:
* An overall assessment of the full financial position of the applicant must be carried out using the AIB for Intermediaries [Affordability Calculator](https://aibni.co.uk/intermediaries/criteria-and-calculator/affordability-calculator) and documented on file with particular emphasis on sustainability of the income. Essential & discretionary expenditure included in our affordability analysis will be based on Office of National Statistics market. Failure to determine income and expenditure in the process is a breach of MCOB.
* Sustainability of income is an important factor when determining capacity to repay.
* The applicant's ability to repay over the life of the loan must be considered. Whilst it is not possible to predict the future, there are circumstances that are foreseeable, such as retirement and these must be taken into account. Other factors such as overall assets/liabilities or knowledge of current and future business plans, may influence the decision to advance funds.
* Where a Letter of Guarantee is taken, the Guarantor's repayment capacity is confirmed in the same way as any borrower.

**Calculating net income for self-employed customers:**

```
Self Employed Net Profit
+ Depreciation
+ Loan Interest
-----------------------------------
Sub Total
- Loan/HP Rep
-----------------------------------
Gross Income
- Tax
-----------------------------------
Net Income
(Divide by 12 for monthly)
```

**Note:** An average of the past 3 years' surplus available to the applicants should be used for the affordability calculation. In cases where there are significant changes in profitability trends these should be referred to our Run By desk in order to agree a sustainable income figure.

## Credit card repayments

In relation to credit cards, please follow this process when completing the affordability calculator. The monthly payment will be one of the following:
* Where outstanding balance is paid in full each month, enter zero
* Where outstanding balance is not paid in full each month, enter a minimum of 5% of outstanding balance

## Other mortgages

This refers to other mortgages (Consumer buy to let, holiday home or investment property loans) that will continue following the drawdown of the new mortgage.

We require this repayment to be stress tested as follows:

**Condition (stress test for other mortgages):**

* **Capital & Interest contracts:** 3% above current rate
* **Interest Only (I/O contract is for duration of Proposed Mortgage):** 3% above current rate on Interest only basis
* **Interest Only (I/O matures pre-expiry date of this Proposed Mortgage):** 3% above current rate and on a Capital & Interest basis over a maximum term of 15 years

**Example:**
* Your current repayment is worked out as follows: £100,000 over 20 years at a rate of 3% = £560.14
* Your stressed repayment is worked out as follows (using the same example): £100,000 over 20 years at a stressed rate of 6% (i.e. 3% + 3%) = £726.54

## Required Surplus

AIB for Intermediaries affordability assessment takes into account a surplus income over the standard living costs.

## Lending into retirement

Generally it is expected that retirement will take place at state retirement age (up to 70 for self-employed) unless there is evidence from employer of an older retirement age. Where the loan term extends beyond retirement the Bank will require appropriate and clear demonstration of affordability beyond anticipated retirement date.

## Transport costs

Transport costs are included in the affordability assessment as part of the standard living costs based on Office of National Statistics market data.

## Minimum living costs

Minimum living costs are factored into the affordability assessment using Office of National Statistics market data for essential and discretionary expenditure.
