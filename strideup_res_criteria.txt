### Employment Status

**Employed:**
* A minimum of 3 months employment history is required, which can include both current and previous roles where there are no gaps in employment
* We can consider applicants during their probationary period and who have been employed in their current job for less than 3 months (excluding zero hours contracts)

**Zero Hours Contracts:**
* We can accept zero hour contract income where it is not the primary income source on an application
* The applicant must have been employed on a zero hour contract within the same industry for at least 12 months

**Second Job:**
* We can consider 100% of this income
* If PAYE, our customer must have been working their primary job and second job for 6 months
* We will need the latest P60 & 3 most recent payslips

**Contractor:**
* We are flexible on how we look at contractors, and realise one size does not fit all:
  * **First time contracting:** If less than 6 months to run on the contract, we need confirmation the applicant has been previously employed for 24 months in the same line of work
  * **Single contract:** 3 month history of contracting is required, with a minimum 12 months history in the same industry (unless first time contracting). There must be a minimum of 3 months remaining on the contract. However, we will accept confirmation of the renewal from the employer if the next contract is not yet available
  * **Multiple contracts:** If customer has multiple contracts, we will treat them as Sole Traders, Ltd Co Director and will request the same evidence as detailed above
  * **Umbrella Company:** We treat contractors that are paid via an Umbrella Company, which pays tax & NI for our customer, as PAYE employed customers, so we will be looking for the latest P60 & latest 3 payslips
  * **Medical professionals:** Whether they work under one or multiple Trusts, we will treat them as a single contractor rather than looking at the SA302s for evidence. Day rates can be considered

**Self-Employed:**
* Most recent year's income accepted if trading for more than 2 years
* SA302 for the last 2 years, together with the Tax Year Overview (or 1 year if trading for less than 2 years) and business bank statements
* Where 2 years' SA302/Tax Year Overviews cannot be provided, other sources to evidence stability of income can be considered, subject to underwriter discretion

### Financing into Retirement

* We can consider applications where the term is due to expire beyond age 70 to (max) age 75 years
* Where retirement is less than 10 years away, affordability will be assessed considering the anticipated retirement income

**Financing into Retirement Evidence:**
* **<10 years away from retirement age:** If pension income is to be used for affordability, we will need to see the latest pension statement which will show a forecast of the pension amount
* **>10 years away from retirement age:** Evidence of contributions into a pension fund (including sale of other property and/or buy to let rental income) must be provided and will be reviewed on a proportionate basis

### Foreign Currency Income
