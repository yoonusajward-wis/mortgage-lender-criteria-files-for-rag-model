## Applicants

The maximum number of applicants is 4. We use the income of the 2 highest earners.

If there are more than 2 applicants our online system can't be used and to get an illustration, a DIP or to apply, call us on 0345 601 0680.

---

## Assignable Contracts

We do not lend on assigned contracts.

This is where a vendor allows the assignment of a purchase contract from the original buyer to a new buyer before completion.

---

## Back to Back Transactions

### Purchase
Also known as a sub-sale, we allow a purchase where the seller has not yet owned the property for 6 months.

We will use the lower of the original purchase price (estate valuation if inherited) and the current valuation, unless the seller has significantly improved the property increasing its value, then we can use the current valuation (or new purchase price if lower). The new ownership must be registered at Land Registry.

For new builds the valuer will need to see the original Disclosure of Incentives Form.

### Remortgage
Also known as a day one remortgage, we allow a remortgage within 6 months of purchasing or inheriting a property.

Within the first 6 months we will use the lower of the original purchase price (estate valuation if inherited) and the current valuation, unless the customer has significantly improved the property increasing its value, then we can use the current valuation. The new ownership must be registered at Land Registry.

Where a property has been gifted, we will not allow a remortgage within the first 6 months of ownership.

### Contact us before applying
You need to let us know if a case is a back to back transaction before applying.

---

## Bank Statements

We don't always need bank statements, but we do need them for certain applications.

### Which applications need bank statements?
- Contractors
- Cash income
- Employed by a family business
- Handwritten payslips/P60s

For self employed customers we may ask for the latest months' business bank statement. We'll let you know if we need it.

---

## Bonus and Variable Income

We accept 100% of contractually guaranteed income from a customer's primary employment. For example, a contractual car allowance, large city weighting or permanent shift allowance.

We accept 60% of variable income that's regular and reliable. For example, bonus, commission or overtime.

### Variable Pay Frequency

**Monthly or more regular:**
- 60% of the lowest of the last 2 months
- If the year to date figure is lower, we'll use 60% of the variable pay showing in the YTD.

**Annual, Half-yearly, Quarterly:**
- 60% of the most recent year
- If the total variable pay is more than basic pay, we use 60% of the 2 year average, or more recent if lower.

Exceptionally, we may be able to use up to 75% of variable income where a 3 year track record of stability is held (2 years if monthly or more regular). This must be agreed with us before applying.

## Capital Raising

### Allowable Purposes
- We allow additional borrowing as part of a remortgage application for most reasons other than business purposes, stocks and shares, currency speculation, time-shares, ASU premiums and tax bills

### Maximum LTV
- The maximum LTV for additional borrowing is 90%
- This includes for the deposit on a new property, home improvements, paying off a Help to Buy Equity Loan in full, fully staircasing shared ownership and any other allowable purpose other than debt consolidation
- The maximum LTV where additional borrowing includes any unsecured debt consolidation is 80%

### Debt Consolidation
- Maximum LTV 80% for debt consolidation
- We include the monthly payments of any debts being repaid (other than Help to Buy Equity Loans) in our affordability assessment as if they were not being paid off
- Debt consolidation is not allowed on interest only. The amount being consolidated must be on capital and interest

---

## Cladding

### New Mortgage Applications

**Multi storey buildings which have multiple occupancy and are either:**
- **Under 11 metres AND 4 storeys or less, anywhere in the UK, or**
- **11 metres or more OR 5 storeys or more, in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland**

Our valuation policy will ensure that a professional valuation is undertaken for these properties. Where the valuer has fire safety concerns with the External Wall System or any other fire safety concerns, they will request a completed External Wall Fire Review Form (EWS1), in line with RICS guidance. Our appointed valuer will check their database to confirm the property's EWS1 status. Where they are unable to do so, we will request the EWS1 form. The EWS1 form should be sent directly to us.

The EWS1 form is the responsibility of the building owner (property owner in Scotland) to undertake. They must appoint a qualified member of one of the appropriate professional bodies to complete and sign the form. The form will confirm that the EWS has been assessed and provide its safety rating. The rating will determine whether we are able to progress the case.

A rating of A1, A2 or B1 will mean that the valuer will determine whether the case can progress and where acceptable, provide an amended valuation report.

A rating of A3 or B2 will mean that the property will be declined where affected by cladding and remediation is required.

**Multi storey buildings in England which have multiple occupancy and are either:**
- **11 metres or more, or**
- **Have 5 or more storeys**

Where a valuer has identified any significant fire safety concerns, or the EWS1 form rating is either A3 or B2, they'll let us know if remediation of the property has been agreed to be funded by either Government funding or by the Developer, if known. We'll then get in touch requesting the following:
- An executed Leaseholder Deed of Certificate.
- An executed Landlord Certificate (for applications where the building is being fully remediated under the Building Safety Act or by the Developer, this certificate will not be required).

Please note that we aren't accepting applications from [non-qualifying leaseholders](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualifying-date-qualifying-lease-and-extent) for buildings that are not being remediated under the Building Safety Act.

We must be satisfied with the information provided to allow us to proceed. You can find more guidance on this documentation on the [government website](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mandatory-information-required-from-leaseholders-and-building-owners).

### Existing Mortgages
We are here to support our existing customers who have a mortgage on a property that is impacted by potentially unsafe EWS. When their current mortgage deal ends we will offer a new mortgage product, just as we always would.

For changes to an existing Virgin Money mortgage we will assess each case based on individual circumstances. As a responsible lender, any application for additional borrowing from customers impacted by unsafe EWS will be carefully considered before a decision is made.

For any other questions about EWS please refer to the [FAQs](https://www.rics.org/news-insights/current-topics-campaigns/fire-safety/cladding-external-wall-system-ews-faqs) provided by RICS or visit the [Government's website](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cladding-remediation) to view their guidance on cladding.

## Contractors

### Daily Rate Contractors
- We will lend to daily rate contractors who have a fixed rate of pay, work schedule and contract duration
- Income is calculated by the current contract multiplied by 46 weeks
- The maximum gap between contracts is 6 weeks. If there is more than a 6 week gap, please contact us - we may still be able to help
- Contractors who earn £50,000 or more must have 1 year's contracting experience or 2 years' experience in same the industry
- Contractors who earn under £50,000 must have 2 years' contracting experience. There is no minimum income requirement
- The maximum LTV is 95%
- If there is less than 1 month remaining on the current contract, evidence of renewal must be held
- It is acceptable for a contractor to have a limited company providing they do not employ other contractors or have more than one contract. Offshore structures are not accepted

### IR35 and Umbrella Companies
- Contractors operating inside IR35 and/or use of a payroll services company (PAYE umbrella company) are accepted
- When reviewing payslips, we will deduct any statutory employer costs (including employer National Insurance contributions and Apprenticeship Levy) and any payroll service costs from the gross pay before multiplying by 46 weeks

### Zero Hour Contracts, Fixed Term Employment, and Agency Contracts
- These are all acceptable where the customer has a 2 year track record in the same line of work, whether on a permanent basis, or as a contractor. For zero hour contracts we need a 2 year track record of that income type
- If the customer has not been in their current job for a year, then we can only use their income if it is consistent with the level received in their previous job
- Seasonal or temporary short term employment is not acceptable

### Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)
We assess CIS income using our [self employed policy](https://intermediaries.virginmoney.com/lending-criteria/residential/self-employed/).

### Evidence
View [packaging requirements](https://intermediaries.virginmoney.com/packaging-requirements/)

---

## Debt Consolidation

The maximum LTV for debt consolidation is 80%.

We include the monthly payments of any debts being repaid (other than Help to Buy Equity Loans) in our affordability assessment as if they were not being paid off.

Debt consolidation is not allowed on interest only. The amount being consolidated must be on capital and interest.

---

## Deposit

### Gifted Deposits
Gifted deposits, such as money gifted by family, are acceptable. Vendor gifted deposits are only acceptable for new build.

### Let-to-Buy Deposits
A deposit from a let-to-buy is acceptable. We do not require simultaneous completion (unless both the BTL and residential transactions of a let-to-buy are being mortgaged with Virgin Money).

Deposits from capital raising against other properties are also acceptable.

### New Builds
For new builds, we allow cash incentives up to 5% of the purchase price up to 90% LTV without affecting the loan amount. If greater than 5%, the balance of the incentive above 5% must be deducted from the purchase price when calculating the maximum loan amount. Where the LTV on a Shared Ownership case is greater than 90%, cash incentives must be deducted from the purchase price when calculating the maximum loan amount.

### Loans
Deposits from loans are only acceptable subject to underwriter assessment. There must be no charge placed on the property we are lending on. Where the deposit is from a loan, this should be confirmed as the source of deposit in the application, and the associated expenditure and repayment terms declared. This includes loans from financial institutions or individuals, such as family members. Just so you know, we won't usually consider scenarios where the deposit is entirely from a loan.

### Forces HTB
Forces HTB loans are accepted as a source of deposit. See our Forces HTB criteria.

### Gifted Equity
Gifted equity is acceptable when buying from a family member. See our discounted purchase criteria.

### ROSCA
Deposits sourced from Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCA), such as an open cooperative funding circle scheme, are not acceptable.

### Evidence
We do not usually require proof of deposit to be provided. The legal rep will confirm the deposit as part of their due diligence. If the deposit is gifted, we require a [gifted deposit form](https://intermediaries.virginmoney.com/downloads/pdf/gifted-deposit-template.pdf).

---

## Discounted Purchase

Also known as a concessionary purchase, an undervalue purchase or use of gifted equity as deposit for a purchase is acceptable when buying from a family member. The seller cannot live in the property after it has been sold.

### How it Works
The LTV will be calculated on the property value instead of the purchase price and we will not lend more than the discounted purchase price.

For example, on a property valued at £200,000 sold at a discount for £150,000, we'd lend up to £150,000 and calculate the LTV as 75%.

### Conditions
The legal rep must establish that the family member selling the property is not insolvent and/or arrange suitable indemnity insurance for the full value of the property, and the buyer and seller must have separate legal representation.

We will need a letter from the family member(s) gifting the equity to confirm that it is a gift and they do not expect to be repaid during the recipient's ownership of the property or on its sale.

We do not allow a remortgage within 6 months of being gifted a property.

---

## Execution Only

We allow execution only applications where all applicants are either High Net Worth or Mortgage Professionals, according to the MCOB definition.

We allow brokers to submit their own applications. They must be submitted on an advised basis rather than execution only basis. We pay the usual procuration fee.

---

## Ex-Pats

We do not lend to ex-pats or customers resident abroad.

UK and Irish nationals resident in the UK but are temporarily working abroad are acceptable subject to:
- Income being in GBP and paid into a UK bank account
- The customer and/or their immediate family occupying the property
- The mortgage being affordable after UK and overseas living costs have been considered
- Not living or working in a [country subject to financial sanctions](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/financial-sanctions-regime-specific-consolidated-lists-and-releases) unless they are a member of British Armed Forces posted in one of these countries

UK residency is determined by the UK's Statutory Residence Test. This does not always require a minimum number of days an individual must be physically present in the UK but confirms if you've been in the UK for 183 or more days in a given tax year, you'll be a UK resident.

---

## First Time Buyers

We define a first time buyer (FTB) as a customer who has never had a mortgage. For a joint application neither customer will have ever had a mortgage.

First time buyers are acceptable up to 95% LTV.

---

## Flats

### LTVs
- Flats in buildings with 4 storeys or fewer are acceptable to 95% LTV
- Flats in buildings with 5-10 storeys are acceptable to 85% LTV (95% for shared ownership)
- Flats in buildings with more than 10 storeys are acceptable to 80% LTV (95% for shared ownership)
- Ex local authority, housing association or MOD flats are acceptable to 85% LTV (but not for shared ownership)
- New build flats are acceptable to 80% LTV (95% for shared ownership)

### Types of Flats
- Converted flats are defined as new build until the later of 2 years after conversion or the date of first occupation
- Studio flats with an internal floor area of at least 30m2 are acceptable
- We treat maisonettes the same as flats

### Multi-Storey
Flats on the 5th storey or higher must be serviced by a lift. Where a flat is located on the 4th storey or below, there is no requirement for a lift to be provided irrespective of the number of floors to the block. Flats on the 5th story or higher which are not serviced by a lift are only considered acceptable if there is demonstrable demand due to the location.

The number of storeys includes all floors and if there are multiple blocks in a development which share an entrance, we will use the storey height of the highest block.

Ex local authority, housing association or MOD flats must not be in a building of over 7 storeys. Deck or balcony access is acceptable subject to valuer comment.

### Commercial Premises
Flats over or adjacent to commercial premises are acceptable subject to valuer assessment including that the commercial premises doesn't detriment demand or enjoyment of the property. The flat's entrance must not be via the commercial premises and flats immediately above or adjacent to food, drink or dry cleaners will usually be unacceptable.

### Tenure
Flats must be leasehold (or in Scotland, heritable or leasehold). Share of freehold properties are acceptable but there must be an acceptable underlying lease upon which we can place our charge.

Freehold flats are only acceptable for a Tyneside flat where there are reciprocating lease/ freehold arrangements, with our security being the lease of the subject flat and the freehold of the other flat.

---

## Forces Help to Buy

Forces HTB is a scheme open to serving members of the armed forces allowing them to borrow up to 50% of their annual salary up to £25,000 interest free. Funds can be used towards a deposit and fees for a residential purchase and are repaid in equal instalments over a 10 year period, deducted from salary with a small insurance premium.

We accept the Forces HTB loan as a residential mortgage deposit.

When applying, please select 'Other' as the source of deposit, and use the box that appears to tell us it's 'Forces HTB'.

It's important to include the Forces HTB loan and insurance payments as expenditure so we know how much the customer will be paying. In the 'Financial Details' section please declare the loan under 'Existing Loan Details' as an 'Unsecured' commitment and include the insurance cost under 'Monthly Outgoings' as 'Insurance & Investments'.

We don't need the customer's personal information note from the MoD which confirms their loan.

We allow Forces HTB for Shared Ownership too, and it'll count towards the minimum 5% personal contribution we need for a Shared Ownership deposit.

---

## Foreign Currency

We do not lend in the case of foreign currency loans. This means:
- We cannot use any non-sterling income. This includes any income contracted or held in a foreign currency which is then converted to sterling
- We cannot consider any non-sterling interest only repayment vehicles
- We cannot lend to any customer resident outside the UK

### UK Residency
UK residency is determined by the UK's Statutory Residence Test. This does not always require a minimum number of days an individual must be physically present in the UK but confirms if you've been in the UK for 183 or more days in a given tax year, you'll be a UK resident.

---

## Foreign Nationals

Virgin Money does not differentiate between UK and Irish Nationals in our lending policy.

Virgin Money's criteria require applicants to have permanent right to reside in the UK (e.g., British citizen, ILR, settled status).

Non-UK/Irish nationals with either the permanent right to reside and work in the UK or a settled or pre-settled EU Settlement Scheme status are accepted on standard lending policy.

All applicants must be resident in the UK and have a 3 year consecutive UK address history.

They do not accept:

• Skilled Worker visas

• Health & Care Worker visas

• Other temporary work visas

Because a Skilled Worker visa does not provide permanent right to reside, Virgin Money would decline such applications.

We cannot lend to nationals of a [country subject to financial sanctions](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/financial-sanctions-regime-specific-consolidated-lists-and-releases) or to a foreign national with diplomatic immunity.

## Foster Carers

Income from foster caring is acceptable and is subject to our usual [self employed policy](https://intermediaries.virginmoney.com/lending-criteria/residential/self-employed/).

Any individuals under foster care should be included as dependants within the application.

---

## Greener Mortgages

Our Greener mortgages give customers access to a range of products that are priced more competitively than the equivalent non-Greener product, rewarding customers for purchasing an energy efficient new build home.

To qualify, customers must be purchasing a new build residential home with a certified or predicted energy rating of A or B, evidenced by an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC), a Predicted Energy Assessment (PEA) or a Standard Assessment Procedure calculation (SAP).

---

## Guarantors

We don't offer guarantor mortgages.

---

## Help to Buy

For customers with a Help to Buy equity loan on a property mortgaged with another lender, we only offer remortgages if the equity loan is being repaid in full.

We don't offer remortgages to customers partially staircasing.

## Income Multiples

### Purchase or Remortgage with Additional Borrowing
- Income under £50,000 – 4.49x
- Income £50,000 to £74,999 – 5x
- Income of £75,000 or more – 5.5x

### Max 4.49x LTI at All Income Levels if Any of the Following Apply:
- Over 85% LTV
- Any applicant is self-employed (not including contractors meeting our contractor policy)
- Shared ownership

### Remortgage with No Additional Borrowing
- Up to 85% LTV – 5.5x
- Over 85% LTV – 4.49x

For a remortgage with no additional borrowing, income level and self-employment don't impact LTI limits.

### Allowable Income
When applying LTI multiples we include all of the following income:
- All forms of income listed in our [income policy](https://intermediaries.virginmoney.com/lending-criteria/residential/income/) at 100%, apart from rental income
- [Variable income](https://intermediaries.virginmoney.com/lending-criteria/residential/bonus-and-variable-income/) at 60%

Rental income is not included for LTI purposes.

This is also how we determine whether a case meets the £50k/£75k income levels referenced above.

---

## Interest Only

### Income
Minimum income of £75,000 sole or joint.

All acceptable income will count towards the minimum at their full levels, except for rental income which we do not include. For example, we will use 100% of the most recent year's bonus rather than the 60% of it that we use for affordability and loan to income purposes.

### Debt Consolidation
Debt consolidation is not allowed on interest only. The amount being consolidated must be on capital and interest.

### Age
Maximum age at the end of the mortgage term 75 and 364 days.

Lending into retirement is not allowed if downsizing is the repayment vehicle.

### Availability
Our standard maximum term of 40 years applies, and interest only is available for remortgage and purchase, but not for first time buyers.

### Maximum LTV and Loan Size
- Full interest only – up to 75% LTV for loan sizes of £1m or less
- Part and part – up to 85% LTV for property values of £750k or less, 80% LTV for property values over £750k up to £1.25m, and 75% LTV for property values over £1.25m (up to our maximum loan size of £1m). No more than 75% LTV on interest only
- The maximum total LTV for downsizing or sale of another property is 65%. This cannot be exceeded by using another repayment vehicle or capital & interest

### Repayment Vehicles

**Downsizing:**
Maximum 65% LTV. This cannot be exceeded by using capital & interest. Downsizing cannot be combined with any other repayment vehicle. Minimum equity at the start of the mortgage £300,000. Maximum age at end of the mortgage term is the lower of 70 and 364 days or the customer's declared retirement age.

**Sale of Other Property:**
Maximum 65% LTV. This cannot be exceeded by using another repayment vehicle or capital & interest. The equity in the other property/properties must be 110% of the amount on interest only, and we'll carry out automated valuations to establish values.

**Pension Lump Sum:**
Maximum 75% LTV. The total LTV can be topped up 85% using capital and interest. The tax free lump sum (25% of the mid-point projected value at retirement) must be 100% of the amount on interest only. The pension must have been in place for at least 12 months.

**Investments (like Stocks & Shares, ISAs, Unit Trusts, OEICs):**
Maximum 75% LTV. The total LTV can be topped up 85% using capital and interest. The investments must have been in place for at least 12 months. If a projected maturity value is available we can use the mid-point, which must be 100% of the amount on interest only. If a projected maturity value is unavailable we will use the current value, which must be 100% of the amount on interest only.

**FTSE 100 Share Portfolio:**
Maximum 75% LTV. The total LTV can be topped up 85% using capital and interest. The current balance must be 110% of the amount on interest only. A share portfolio must have been held for at least 12 months and the shares must be FTSE 100.

**Endowments:**
Maximum 75% LTV. The total LTV can be topped up 85% using capital and interest. The mid-point projected maturity value must be 100% of the amount on interest only. The endowment must have been in place for at least 12 months and the maturity date must be on or before the end of the mortgage term.

All repayment vehicles must be held in sterling.

### Allowable Income
To calculate whether customers meet our interest only minimum income requirement we include all forms of income listed in our [income policy](https://intermediaries.virginmoney.com/lending-criteria/residential/income/) at 100%, except for rental income which we do not include.

We include 100% of variable income (rather than the 60% used for income multiples and affordability).

## Leasehold

### Tenure
- Leasehold properties are acceptable
- Share of freehold properties are acceptable but there must be an acceptable underlying lease upon which we can place our charge

### Leases
Leases should have at least 85 years remaining at the time of application. If a lease is in the process of being extended it is acceptable for it to be under 85 years at application if it will have 85 years remaining at completion. Leases with under 85 years remaining can be considered by exception but please check with us before applying.

Leases which contain a provision for periodic increase of the ground rent are acceptable if the amount remains reasonable throughout its term. Increases should usually be linked to RPI or similar. If subject to a multiplier, any multipliers which cause a doubling of rent every period of 15 years or less are not permitted.

Ground rent must not exceed £250 per annum at any point during the lease term. In Greater London it's £1,000. We don't accept indemnity policies for this matter, instead leases must be varied so that the ground rent does not rise above the threshold.

## Lending into Retirement

### After or Approaching Retirement
If a customer is already retired, or the term extends to or beyond the customer's declared retirement age or their 71st birthday and they are within 10 years of either date we will use their pension income for affordability, or current income if lower.

### Over 10 Years Before Retirement
If the term extends to or beyond the customer's declared retirement age or their 71st birthday but the customer is not within 10 years of either date, we don't need proof of income in retirement but we do need to see that the customer is paying in to a pension plan.

### Self Employed
For self-employed customers we may be able to use their current income up to age 75 and 364 days. This is subject to their line of work and business activities. Please check with us before applying.

### Acceptable Pensions
The following types of pension are all acceptable: annuities, occupational (defined benefits / final salary, defined contribution / money purchase), pension tax credits, personal (stakeholder, SIPP), state, war, war disability.

### Interest Only
Lending into retirement is not allowed if downsizing is the repayment vehicle.

## New Build

### Maximum LTV
- We lend up to 90% LTV for a new build house and 80% LTV for a new build flat
- For shared ownership new build we lend up to 95% of the share of the property being purchased

### Definition
**When do we define a property as a new build?**
- Up to 2 years after it was built, converted or first occupied, whichever is later
- If it's being sold by the builder or developer, regardless of when it was built or converted
- If it's a flat that's been converted from a building with a different, non-residential use (for example, a church, office block, shop or factory), the 2 year rule above also applies

A residential house that is converted into flats is not defined as a new build.

### Incentives

**Cash Incentives:**
Cash incentives up to 5% of the purchase price are accepted up to 90% LTV without affecting the loan amount. If greater than 5%, the balance of the incentive above 5% must be deducted from the purchase price when calculating the maximum loan amount.

Where the LTV on a Shared Ownership case is greater than 90%, cash incentives must be deducted from the purchase price when calculating the maximum loan amount.

Cashback deals, Stamp Duty paid, payment of professional fees (solicitors, surveyors etc) and guaranteed rental payments for a specific period, are all considered to be cash incentives.

**Non-Cash Incentives:**
Non-cash incentives are accepted without affecting the loan amount. Incentives which are fixed or fitted to the property or white goods are considered to be non-cash incentives.

### Warranty
Properties built or converted in the last 10 years must have been issued with an acceptable warranty or professional consultant's certificate. Find out more in our [property criteria](https://intermediaries.virginmoney.com/lending-criteria/residential/property/).

### Offers
New build offers are valid for 210 days.

Further offer extensions of 210 days require up to date documentation, a new on sale product to be selected and re-assessment against current criteria. We will also refer to the valuer to determine whether the original valuation report can be used, an updated valuation figure should be used or a reinspection is required. This will not result in additional product or valuation fees.

---

## Offers

### Validity
Offers are valid for 180 days. For new build it's 210 days.

### Amendments
We can usually make changes to existing offers if you need to amend things like the term, loan amount, repayment method, or purchase price. Just contact us to let us know what you need to change. Where this requires a change to product, the range used should be our current new business range.

We allow a change of product using the current product range as many times as needed prior to completion. This can be pre-offer or post-offer, up until we have received the Certificate of Title from the solicitor. We can't make changes to the product after the COT has been received. If it's just the product you need to change, our [mortgage product switch form](https://intermediaries.virginmoney.com/downloads/pdf/new-business-product-switch-form.pdf) is the easiest way to do it.

Some changes need a brand new application. These include a change of property, adding or removing applicants, or changing the application type from residential to BTL and vice versa.

### Extending an Offer
Offer extensions are not available for non-new build properties. Instead, we require a brand new application including new product and valuation. A new valuation fee will apply if selecting a product with a valuation fee. Any product fee paid can be transferred to the new application.

For new build properties we can extend offers for a further 210 days and will require up to date documentation, a new on sale product to be selected and re-assessment against current criteria.

We will also refer to the valuer to determine whether the original valuation report can be used, an updated valuation figure should be used or a reinspection is required. This will not result in additional product or valuation fees.

---

## Parental Leave

When someone is on parental leave (often maternity leave or paternity leave), we'll use their return to work income subject to confirming their intended return to work date, which should be in the next 12 months. We'll also need to confirm their working hours.

If they're not returning in the next 3 months, we'll need to know how they will afford their commitments until they return to work (employee benefits, statutory pay, partner's income, savings, for example). If they're returning within the next 3 months, this information is not needed.

Any future childcare costs should be included within the application.

View [packaging requirements](https://intermediaries.virginmoney.com/packaging-requirements/)

## Probation

---

## Product Fees

Product fees can be added to the mortgage without affecting our LTV calculation, but the total borrowing cannot exceed 95% LTV.

When an application includes more than one product the overall loan amount determines the products available, and the product fees for each product chosen will apply.

All our mortgages have a funds transfer fee of £25 for us to send mortgage funds to the legal rep.
